            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing very Å¿enÅ¿ible of a great Injury lately done mee, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme falÅ¿e printing of a Å¿mal TreatiÅ¿e of my CompoÅ¿ing, Å¿toln out without my conÅ¿ent, and hearing accidentally that Å¿ome part of this alÅ¿o had paÅ¿Å¿ed the PreÅ¿Å¿e, I thought good for the preventing of the like wrong to Å¿tay the forwardneÅ¿Å¿e of the printer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I had reviewed and corrected it by mine owne Notes. For my part, I Å¿hould have been contented altogether to have reÅ¿trained it, if I might, But now Å¿eeing it muÅ¿t abroad, I Å¿hall not bee aÅ¿hamed to let it beare my name, and owne the errors of it my Å¿elf (thoÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:157030:3"/> of the PreÅ¿Å¿e excepted) though hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had gayned Å¿o much reputation by Å¿ome, as it was attributed to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier Author. Some there are yet Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving that heard this Argument about thirty yeeres Å¿ince in the <hi>Commons-HouÅ¿e</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but it hath now exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it Å¿elfe beyond the probable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a Speech or Argument, by the inÅ¿ertion of many Records and Acts of Parliament more at large, which at the delivery of it, were but meerely quoted.</p>
            <p>The Endeavour of it is to prove that the juÅ¿t Prerogative of our Kings never warranted them to raiÅ¿e monies at their pleaÅ¿ure, by laying a charge on Merchandize to bee Exported or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament. But, on the contrary, the Å¿etled Lawes of the Land, the PreÅ¿idents of former Ages, the Acts of our moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿itous and powerfull Princes, and indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing requiÅ¿ite to make the Truth
<pb facs="tcp:157030:3"/> apparent, doe as it were unanimouÅ¿ly conÅ¿ent to diÅ¿charge us of this unjuÅ¿t and heavy Burthen.</p>
            <p>And you Å¿hall Å¿ee herein how the policy of active Princes hath by many waies attempted to undermine thoÅ¿e Fortifications which the wiÅ¿dom of our AnceÅ¿tors hath rayÅ¿ed to maintaine themÅ¿elves from this kinde of AÅ¿Å¿ault. You Å¿hall Å¿ee with how great difficulty their prevailing was withÅ¿tood: And (which is the glory of Truth) you Å¿hall finde thoÅ¿e deÅ¿ignes which were laid to overthrow our Right, mainly to make for the evidence and confirmation of it. For, whatever unjuÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were either exacted by a pretended lawfullneÅ¿Å¿e, or Å¿et up by a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power, were by complaint in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments preÅ¿ently following taken down, and remain on Record as (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves) unlawfull, and againÅ¿t our Libertie.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons and Arguments of
<pb facs="tcp:157030:4"/> mine (how meane Å¿oever) thoÅ¿e times wherein I urged them, accepted favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; and Å¿ince, in their private paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age in manuÅ¿cripts, were entertained in many judicious hands, which made mee Å¿omwhat enlarge the conceit that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had of them; And now Å¿eeing neceÅ¿Å¿itie enforceth mee to make them more publique, I muÅ¿t adventure them to the cenÅ¿ure of theÅ¿e nice times. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall (happily) they may be to Å¿ome, prejudiciall I hope to none: In which confidence (having the leave of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) they have likewiÅ¿e my leave to goe abroad.</p>

            <p>I MuÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e, that when this Point was firÅ¿t Å¿tirred mongÅ¿t us, and that wee, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to Å¿eeke redreÅ¿Å¿e for the exceÅ¿Å¿e of the preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions, reÅ¿olved to proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by calling his MajeÅ¿ties right of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing into queÅ¿tion, I was very Å¿ory: for I Å¿aw we were then in a faire way to have obteined a very great abatement of the ImpoÅ¿itions that now
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157030:6"/> are; and beÅ¿ides, we had his MajeÅ¿ties promiÅ¿e never to lay any more but in Parliament time, by the advice and free conÅ¿ent of his Subjects, repayring hither from all parts of the Realme; This hope of a preÅ¿ent eaÅ¿e, and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e for the time to come, gave me (I confeÅ¿Å¿e) a full Å¿atisfaction; eÅ¿pecially, Å¿eeing I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently perÅ¿waded that his MajeÅ¿ties right to impoÅ¿e was very cleere and not to be diÅ¿puted, and that therfore by drawing into queÅ¿tion the right, wee might give his MajeÅ¿ty juÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion to withdraw from us his gracious purpoÅ¿e of the preÅ¿ent abatement, as alÅ¿o his promiÅ¿e for the time to come: For Syr, when the CaÅ¿e of <hi>Bates</hi> (who as you know was called into queÅ¿tion for refuÅ¿ing to pay the ImpoÅ¿ition laid upon <hi>Currans</hi>) was argued in the Exchequer, in which CaÅ¿e his MajeÅ¿ties right to ImpoÅ¿e, was Å¿olemnly diÅ¿puted (and there reÅ¿olved for his MajeÅ¿ty) I was then preÅ¿ent at all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both at the Bar and at the Bench; And I doe confeÅ¿Å¿e that by the weighty and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿werable reaÅ¿ons (as I then conceived them) of thoÅ¿e grave and reverend Judges,<note place="margin">

Thus much I thought good to Å¿ay by way of Preamble or Introduction to the matter: now (by your favors) I will enter into the debate of the QueÅ¿tion; in handling of which I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ely avoid the repetition of any thing that hath been Å¿poken by any man that hath argued before, as knowing in what preÅ¿ence I Å¿peake. That I may the better convey my Å¿elfe through my Argument, and be the better conceived of you that are to heare me, I will divide that which I have to Å¿ay into certain parts, which I will proÅ¿ecute in order.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, I hold it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to conÅ¿ider whether CuÅ¿tom were due to the king by the Common-Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, admitting it to bee due by the Common-Law, whether it were a Å¿umme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not to be increaÅ¿ed at the kings pleaÅ¿ure, or otherwiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing that by the Common-Law the king might, by way of impoÅ¿ition,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157030:7"/> have increaÅ¿ed his CuÅ¿tom at his owne will, by his abÅ¿olute power, without aÅ¿Å¿ent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether or no hee bee not bound to the contrary by Acts of Parliament; In the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of which part, I will conÅ¿ider the Å¿trength of every Act of Parliament hitherto vouched to this purpoÅ¿e, anÅ¿wering, as I goe, Å¿uch obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as have been made againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e Statutes by Å¿uch as have mainteined that the king is not bound by them. I will alÅ¿o add a Statute or two as yet not remembred by any. LaÅ¿tly, I will diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto you the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿uch ReaÅ¿ons as have been made in maintenance of the Kings right to ImpoÅ¿e; in the proÅ¿ecuting of which parts I will (as occaÅ¿ion is offered) give Å¿ome anÅ¿were to that which hath been laÅ¿t Å¿poken; as knowing it to be expected at my hands.<note place="margin">By Sir <hi>Robert Hitcham.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t then to conÅ¿ider <hi>Whether there were by the Common-Law any duty belonging to the King upon Merchandize to be caried into or out of the kingdom, known by the name of CuÅ¿tom.</hi> Though the mainteinance of CuÅ¿tome to be due by the Common-Law be a point of Å¿uch conÅ¿equence to them that mainteined the Kings right to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, as without the upholding of which their opinion (as I conceive) is not Å¿o much as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourably to be mainteined, and that to maintein the Å¿ame it be not at all neceÅ¿Å¿ary to induce my concluÅ¿ion; and although to admit it, it may Å¿eem perhaps no good policy of Argument, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157030:8"/> rather a great diÅ¿advantage to me to admit that, without which the contrary part cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their opinion, and which being admitted cannot make any thing for me; yet becauÅ¿e we are here not as Arguers at the Bar, but as Judges in a high-Court, and that all our ends tend to the diÅ¿covery of the truth: I will therefore not only admit it, but will maintein it as well as I can.</p>
            <p>That CuÅ¿tom is due by the Common-Law I collect,<note place="margin">That there was ever Å¿ome Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome due by the Common Law.</note> firÅ¿t by the name thereof, for though at this day it bee (and Å¿o hath beene for more then 350 yeeres as I Å¿hall have occaÅ¿ion more fully anon to open unto you) called in our law-Latin <hi>CuÅ¿tuma,</hi> yet in ancient time it had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name here amongÅ¿t us (for I meane not to wander into forreign-learning) then <hi>ConÅ¿uetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> as may appeare by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> cap. 30. <hi>Per rectas &amp; antiquas ConÅ¿uetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> (for I Å¿hall anon directly prove unto you that <hi>ConÅ¿uetudo</hi> in that place is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood, a uÅ¿age, as hath been Å¿aid; but in that Å¿ence which I, take it.) This name <hi>ConÅ¿uetudo</hi> in the Å¿ame Å¿enÅ¿e is alÅ¿o found in many ancient Records brought into this houÅ¿e upon the late Å¿earch; That this name then <hi>ConÅ¿uetudo,</hi> which implies an approved continuance without a known beginning Å¿hould by the Common-Law be given to this Revenue more then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Revenue belonging to the King; nay, that this terme which is the common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:157030:8"/> name to all common and approved uÅ¿ages, of what nature or kinde Å¿oever Å¿hould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this dutie rather then to any other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t all the ancient uÅ¿ages and CuÅ¿tomes which the Common-Law imbraceth, cannot but denote the great antiquity thereof, and more then Å¿o, the allowance and approbation thereof by the Common-Law; for doubtleÅ¿Å¿e, if, beÅ¿ide the antiquity of this dutie, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law had not alÅ¿o alowed the reaÅ¿onable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of it, and in a manner the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of it, it would never have denoted it unto us by this name of excellency above all other CuÅ¿tomes which require reaÅ¿onablenes as well as antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Therfore doubtleÅ¿Å¿e this duty, thus favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is a Childe of the Common-Law; nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is of the very eÅ¿Å¿ence of a CuÅ¿tome to have his only beginning by alowance of the Common-Law; for that which beginneth by private contract of partie, or by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; dependeth not wholly upon the alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Common-Law (by one of which three waies, all things conÅ¿iderable in Law, have their commencements) cannot bee called or bee a CuÅ¿tome, in Name or Deede; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conÅ¿idering that this CuÅ¿tome is not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any one place within the Realme, wee Å¿hall Å¿o little neede to be curious in affirming it to bee due by the Common-Law, as wee may boldly pronounce it to be part of the Common-Law it Å¿elfe. Thus you Å¿ee that the very name
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157030:9"/> 
               <hi>ConÅ¿uetudo</hi> proves CuÅ¿tome to bee a dutie by Common-Law: To this may bee added that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> cap. 30. which (Statute was made little more then 150 yeeres after the ConqueÅ¿t) termeth this not only <hi>ConÅ¿uetudo</hi> (which as I have Å¿aid, implies Antiquity beyond all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a beginning) but <hi>Antiqua ConÅ¿uetudo;</hi> not onely CuÅ¿tome, but old and ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome. And in compariÅ¿on to this old CuÅ¿tome due at Common-Law, the CuÅ¿tome upon Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Commodities, given or increaÅ¿ed by act of Parliament, 3 <hi>E.</hi> 1. not printed, was called <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va ConÅ¿uetudo:</hi> Before the making of which Statute of 3 <hi>E.</hi> 1. you may further Å¿ee, that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome was due: For <hi>an.</hi> 52. <hi>H.</hi> 3. in the Statute of the Exchequer, printed, you may read, that the Collectors of the CuÅ¿tome of Wools were to yeeld their accompt twice every yeere into the Exchequer. But that which moÅ¿t of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me to beleeve that this duty was and is due by the Common-Law, is this; That in all CaÅ¿es where the Common-Law putteth the King to Å¿uÅ¿taine Charge for the protection of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it alwayes yeeldeth him out of the thing protected Å¿ome gaine towards the maintenance of the Charge: As for the protection of Wards, Lunatiques, and Ideots, the profits of their Lands; For the maintenance of the Courts of JuÅ¿tice, it giveth him Fines for purchaÅ¿e of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall writs, and Fines <hi>pro licentia Concordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> which in Å¿uppoÅ¿ition of Law are no other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:157030:9"/> than Fines paid for not proceeding according to the Å¿urety by pledges, put in upon purchaÅ¿e of the Originall; and for troubling without cauÅ¿e the Kings JuÅ¿tices, who are maintained in their places at the Kings charge: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like profits of Court given by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law to the King for the maintenance of his charge in the adminiÅ¿tring of JuÅ¿tice.</p>
            <p>This obÅ¿ervation, which might be further proved by divers other inÅ¿tances in things of other nature, maketh me to think, that becauÅ¿e the Common-Law expecteth that the King Å¿hould protect Merchants in their Trades, by maintaining, repairing, and fortifying the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens at home; by clearing the Sea of Pirates and Enemies in their paÅ¿Å¿age; and by maintaining AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors abroad to treate with forreigne Princes upon all Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions: That it alÅ¿o gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him out of Merchandizes exported and imported, Å¿ome profit for the Å¿uÅ¿tentation of this publique charge; otherwiÅ¿e were the Law very unreaÅ¿onable and unjuÅ¿t. So as to prove that by the Common-Law CuÅ¿tome is due to the King, I Å¿hall need to Å¿ay no more; eÅ¿pecially conÅ¿idering it hath not onely been yeelded to, but proved by thoÅ¿e which maintain a contrary ConcluÅ¿ion. I will therefore proceed to my Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ConÅ¿ideration: <hi>Whether that profit upon Merchandizes, which the Common-Law for theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects gave unto the King, were a duty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, not to be increaÅ¿ed or inhaunced at the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:157030:10"/> Kings will and pleaÅ¿ure, without a common aÅ¿Å¿ent in Parliament? Or otherwiÅ¿e, Whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law hath left an abÅ¿olute power in the King, to demand in this caÅ¿e more or leÅ¿Å¿e at his owne pleaÅ¿ure, and to compell his Subjects to pay it?</hi> The reÅ¿olving of which queÅ¿tion will as I conceive, make an end of this controverÅ¿ie between us; for what are theÅ¿e ImpoÅ¿itions which wee complaine of, other than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauncing of the CuÅ¿tome by the Kings abÅ¿olute pleaÅ¿ure?</p>
            <p>That this duty given by the Common-Law (as I have proved) unto the King,<note place="margin">That CuÅ¿tome due by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, was a Sum certain.</note> was and is a duty certain, not to be enhaunced by the King at his owne pleaÅ¿ure, without aÅ¿Å¿ent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I hope I Å¿hall be able cleerly to prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: In mainteinance of which, I will uÅ¿e Å¿ome Arguments of direct proofe, and others of great preÅ¿umption and probability. And firÅ¿t, I lay this as a ground which will not be denyed me by any man; <hi>That the Common-Law of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>(as alÅ¿o all other wiÅ¿e Lawes in the World) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in certainty, and abandon incertainty, as the mother of all debate and confuÅ¿ion, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more odious in Law:</hi> And therfore the rule is, <hi>Quod certum eÅ¿t retinendum eÅ¿t, quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certum eÅ¿t dimittendum;</hi> nay further, <hi>quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certum eÅ¿t nihil eÅ¿t:</hi> This is the cenÅ¿ure of Law upon all the acts of men which fall under the judgment of the Law. If then the Law Å¿o judge of the acts of men, holding them for nought and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:157030:10"/> voyde that are incertaine; how much more then doth the Law require certainty in her own Acts, which are to binde all men: And if in any of the acts of Law certainty be to be Å¿pecially expected, moÅ¿t of all is it requiÅ¿ite that bounds of limitation and certainty be Å¿et between the King and his poor Subject, between the mighty and the weak, between the Lion and the Lamb. And if in any CaÅ¿e between the King and his Subject more than other, this certainty be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, moÅ¿t of all it is requiÅ¿ite in CaÅ¿es where the Common-Law giveth the King a perpetuall profit or revenue to be raiÅ¿ed out of the intereÅ¿t and property of his poor Subjects eÅ¿tate, either in lands or goods. If in all other things the Law (as I have Å¿aid, and wherein I Å¿uppoÅ¿e you have yeelded to me) doe require certainty and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and onely in this caÅ¿e where it is moÅ¿t requiÅ¿ite, it hath omitted and neglected it, we muÅ¿t conclude the Law to be moÅ¿t unreaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, improvident, and contrary to it Å¿elfe; which to Å¿ay, were to conclude it to be no Law. Out of theÅ¿e grounds I may then in my opinion Å¿afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with Å¿ome confidence deduce and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this poÅ¿ition;<note place="margin">That all the Revenue; which the Common Law giveth to the King out of the intereÅ¿t of the Subject are certain, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable to a certainty by a legall courÅ¿e: and none left to the Kings pleaÅ¿ure.</note> 
               <hi>That the Common-Law of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>giveth to the King, as to the head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, no perpetuall revenue or matter of profit out of the intereÅ¿t or property of the Subject, but it either limiteth a certainty therein at the firÅ¿t, or otherwiÅ¿e hath Å¿o provided, that if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine in it Å¿elfe, it is reduceable to a certainty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:157030:11"/> onely by a legal courÅ¿e, that is to Å¿ay, either by Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, by Judges, or Jury; &amp; not by the Kings own abÅ¿olute will and pleaÅ¿ure.</hi> Though this PoÅ¿ition be grounded upon thoÅ¿e Å¿ure foundations out of which I have (as you perceive) drawn it, and needs no farther proof: yet becauÅ¿e you Å¿hal Å¿ee how plentiful the truth is in reaÅ¿ons to maintain it Å¿elfe, I will further open unto you the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reaÅ¿ons of this poÅ¿ition, which are theÅ¿e:</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, the Law requireth certainty in matter of profit,<note place="margin">The ReaÅ¿ons why the Law requireth Å¿uch certainty in thoÅ¿e Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</note> between the King and the poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauÅ¿e to make any man Judge in his own caÅ¿e, eÅ¿pecially the mighty over the weake, and that in a point of profit to him that judgeth, were to leave a way open to oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and bondage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauÅ¿e by reducing it to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the King may know what certainty to expect; that Å¿o he may order his charge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Subject may know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e what he is to pay, that Å¿o he may know certainly what Å¿hall remaine to him as his own.</p>
            <p>Finally, that the King may not depend upon the good will of his Subject for his revenue, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law expecteth he Å¿hould beare the charge, but may know in certainty what to claime as due to him, and may accordingly compell the Subject to pay it; and that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may not be under the Kings abÅ¿olute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to pay what the King pleaÅ¿eth, which may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:157030:11"/> perhaps extend to the whole value of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize.</p>
            <p>You Å¿ee in generall, how the Law by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring certainty in matter of profit between the King and the Subject, preventeth many miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes which would fall out if the Law were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e; and therefore without more Å¿aying, I might here conclude, that CuÅ¿tome being due by the Common-Law, was and is a Å¿um certain, not to be increaÅ¿ed at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure by way of ImpoÅ¿ition: but becauÅ¿e there are many other revenues due to the King by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, as well as CuÅ¿tome; if they all, or as many as we can call to minde, Å¿hall fall out to bee (as I have Å¿aid) Å¿ummes certaine and not Å¿ubject to bee increaÅ¿ed at the kings will, this will bee a forcible Argument, that cuÅ¿tome is likewiÅ¿e certain and not to be inhannced at the kings pleaÅ¿ure; for, this Argument drawne <hi>Ã  Å¿imili</hi> is of great force, and the moÅ¿t uÅ¿uall of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other in debate of things doubtfull in Law. <hi>Quae Legibus deciÅ¿a non Å¿unt Index ex his quae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿a Å¿unt Å¿tatuet, &amp; de Å¿imilibus ad Å¿imilia proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi> May it pleaÅ¿e you to conÅ¿ider in this reÅ¿pect other revenues which the Common-Law of this Land giveth the King;<note place="margin">Examples of Revenues gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon-Law to the King, out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t of the Subject; that they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> and according to the rule, to decide that which is in queÅ¿tion by the Å¿ame rule and meaÅ¿ure by which other things of the Å¿ame nature have been decided and ordered. The Common-Law giveth the King a Fine for the purchaÅ¿e of an original writ;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:157030:12"/> Is it certaine? it is, and ever hath been; if the debt or damages demanded amount to above forty pounds, the Fine is, and ever hath been Å¿ixe Å¿hil. eight pence, and no more: if to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, then ten Å¿hillings, and no more: May the King increaÅ¿e this Fine at his pleaÅ¿ure? there is no man that will Å¿ay he may. There is a Fine due by the Common-Law, <hi>pro Licentia concordandi;</hi> is it not certainly known, and Å¿o hath alwayes been, to be the tenth part of the Land compriÅ¿ed in the writ of Covenant? And is not alÅ¿o the PoÅ¿t-Fine thereupon due certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to be once and a halfe as much more as the Fine <hi>pro licentia concordandi,</hi> or Pre-Fine? As for example, when the Pre-fine is ten Å¿hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, the PoÅ¿t-fine to be fifteen Å¿hillings: and can the King demand any more of the Subject? So likewiÅ¿e, when in a writ of Right, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant alleadging the Å¿eiÅ¿in of his AnceÅ¿tor, will not be compelled to prove the Å¿eiÅ¿in allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, is he not to tender to the King a Å¿umme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a demy-mark, to have this benefit? was it ever more or leÅ¿Å¿e? or can it now be more if the King would? theÅ¿e, amongÅ¿t many others, are duties belonging to the King by the Common Law from the Subject, for the maintaina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of his Charge in the adminiÅ¿tration of JuÅ¿tice, which the Civilians call <hi>Vectigal Judiciarium.</hi> There are alÅ¿o in divers other CaÅ¿es duties certain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King by the Common-Law: As for example; the reliefe for an Earledome is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:157030:12"/> knowne to be a hundred pounds; for a Barony a hundred markes; for a Knights fee a hundred Å¿hillings: all which in the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> are called old and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient duties: this is <hi>Vectigal Patrimoniale;</hi> of which Å¿ort I could produce many others, all which have like certainty. Nay, there is one duty well known to us all, which the Common-Law giveth to the King; and is in his nature a CuÅ¿tome (our very caÅ¿e) in which the King is bound to a certainty which he cannot exceed; and that is <hi>PriÅ¿age,</hi> a duty given by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law to the King, upon every Å¿hiploading of Wine brought into the kingdom by EngliÅ¿h Merchants; and is one Tun of Wine before the MaÅ¿t, and another behinde. I am unwilling to trouble you with any more particulars of this kinde: but let any man Å¿hew me one particular to the contrary, and I will then yeeld, that my poÅ¿ition being falÅ¿e in one, may be in more: But till my poÅ¿ition hath been in this point infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, this generall concordance of the Law in all theÅ¿e particulars, is argument enough for me, without having aleadged other reaÅ¿ons, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that CuÅ¿tome being as all theÅ¿e are, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue due to the King by the Common-Law, ariÅ¿ing out of the Property and intereÅ¿t of the Subject, is (as all theÅ¿e are) limited and bounded by the Common-Law to a certainty, which the King hath not power to increaÅ¿e: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>bi eadem Ratio, eadem Lex.</hi> It may perhaps be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:157030:13"/> that the Ayd paid to the King upon the Knighting of his eldeÅ¿t Sonne, or marriage of his eldeÅ¿t Daughter, was by the Common-Law uncertaine; and that the King did take more or leÅ¿Å¿e at his pleaÅ¿ure, untill he was bound to the contrary by Statute. To this I make divers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wers: Though it were indeed a Å¿umme uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yet the Common-Law did in Å¿ome Å¿ort give it a limitation; for it is by a Å¿peciall name called <hi>ReaÅ¿onable Ayd:</hi> So as if the Å¿umme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded doe exceed ReaÅ¿on, it became from a <hi>ReaÅ¿onable Ayd</hi> an unjuÅ¿t exaction. BeÅ¿ides, this revenue was a thing happening very rarely, and therefore the certainty thereof not Å¿o much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the Law: and yet it is to be obÅ¿erved how the frame of this Common-wealth could not long indure incertainty even in this caÅ¿uall Revenue; but it was reduced to a certainty of twenty Å¿hillings upon a Knights fee, and 20<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. upon every twenty pounds Soccageland, by the Stat. of <hi>WeÅ¿t.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 35.3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. If in this caÅ¿uall Revenue they were Å¿o carefull to be at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, to avoid unreaÅ¿onable exactions (as the words of the Statute are) how much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full would they have been, for the Å¿ame cauÅ¿e to have reduced the great and annuall Revenue of the CuÅ¿tome to a certainty, if they had not thought it to have been certaine by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, or limited by Statute-Law before that time made? But (Sir) that which I rely upon for anÅ¿wer to this objection, is this: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:157030:13"/> Ayd was and is by the Common-Law due as well to meane Lords as to the King: But meane Lords were not limited to a certainty, otherwiÅ¿e than in generall, that it muÅ¿t be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable, as I have Å¿aid; therefore to limit the King any further, was no reaÅ¿on: And this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer may be given for all uncertaine Revenues belonging to the King, the like of which mean Lords have of their Tenants; for the incertainty of which there may alÅ¿o be given eÅ¿peciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e duties firÅ¿t began by Å¿peciall contract and agreement between the Lord and the Tenant, and not directly by operation of the Common Law, and Å¿o were certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as they did at firÅ¿t agree: and therefore you may be pleaÅ¿ed to remember, how in laying my poÅ¿itio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> I was wary to Å¿ay, <hi>That Å¿uch revenues as are due to the King as to the head of the Common wealth</hi> (by which I purpoÅ¿ely excluded Å¿uch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues as are common to him with other mean Lords) <hi>are alwayes certaine.</hi> I am now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to promiÅ¿e, and in maintenance of a Å¿econd part of my poÅ¿ition, to Å¿hew you, <hi>That where the Common-Law giveth the King a Revenue not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at the firÅ¿t, that is alwayes reduceable to a certainty by a legal courÅ¿e, as by act of Parliament, Judges, or Jury, and not at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure.</hi> Every man that by his tenure is bound to Å¿erve the King in his warres, and faileth, is to pay according to the quantity of his Tenure, a fine by the name of EÅ¿cuage; this cannot be aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:157030:14"/> but in Parliament: Upon forfeitures for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, or otherwiÅ¿e, to the King; though it be a kinde of a certainty that the Law giveth, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him all the eÅ¿tate of the party convict, both in goods and Lands, or in goods onely, as the caÅ¿e is; yet for reducing it to a more expreÅ¿Å¿e certainty, the Law requireth that it be found by Office. <hi>Wayfe, Stray, Wreck, TreaÅ¿ure-Trove,</hi> and Å¿uch like, are no leÅ¿Å¿e certaine; for the King hath the things themÅ¿elves in kinde. Fines for miÅ¿demeanors are alwayes aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by the Judges, Amercements in all caÅ¿es are to be afferred by the Country, and not to be aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by the King, though the forme of the Judgement be, <hi>Et Å¿it in miÅ¿ecordia Domini Regis,</hi> in the Kings mercy <hi>pro contemptu predict.</hi> Nay, though for puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an offence it be by Statute-Law ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that an offendor Å¿hall make Fine and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, the Law even in this caÅ¿e (which is as Å¿trong a caÅ¿e as may be) will not leave the aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing of the Fine to the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, to be by him rated privately in his Chamber; but it muÅ¿t be Å¿olemnly and legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in an open Court of JuÅ¿tice by the Judges, who in all other caÅ¿es are to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his people, where the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t or property of the Subject, or any charge or burden upon them doth come in queÅ¿tion, as may be proved by the booke of 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>fo.</hi> 11. InÅ¿omuch that I am of opinion, that if a Statute were made, that the King might raiÅ¿e the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tomes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:157030:14"/> at his pleaÅ¿ure, yet might it not be done as now it is, by the Kings abÅ¿olute power, but by Å¿ome other legall courÅ¿e, of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law doth take notice; as in the caÅ¿e of the Fine and RanÅ¿ome: much leÅ¿Å¿e then will the Common-Law permit, that it Å¿hould depend upon the Kings abÅ¿olute pleaÅ¿ure, there being no Å¿uch Statute in the caÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>You have heard out of what grounds I firÅ¿t deduced this my poÅ¿ition, <hi>That the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth certainty in matter of profit between the King and his people.</hi> You have heard likewiÅ¿e the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaÅ¿ons of that poÅ¿ition: you have alÅ¿o heard what proofe I have made by particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of like nature to this in queÅ¿tion; and how I have applyed them to the point: And Å¿o lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Judgement of the whole to your wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, who can beÅ¿t diÅ¿cerne whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be of weight, I proceed to my Å¿econd ReaÅ¿on, which is drawne from <hi>the policy and frame of this Common-wealth, and the providence of the Common-Law: The which, as it requires at the Subjects hands loyalty and obedience to their Soveraigne; Å¿o doth it likewiÅ¿e require at the hands of the Soveraigne, protection and defence of the Subject againÅ¿t all wrongs and injuries whatÅ¿oever offered either by one Subject to another, or by the Common Enemy to them all, or any of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Protection, the Law conÅ¿idereth, cannot be without a great charge to the King;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:157030:15"/> And becauÅ¿e, as ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>No man goeth to warre upon his owne charge;</hi> the Common-Law therefore hath not onely given the King great Prerogatives and favours touching his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, more (I beleeve) than any other Prince in the world hath; but alÅ¿o hath, for the Å¿uÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his great and neceÅ¿Å¿ary expences in the protection of his Subjects, given him out of the intereÅ¿t and property of the Subject an ample, and very honorable revenue in very many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caÅ¿es, Å¿ome of which I will call to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
            <p>He receiveth out of the Subjects purÅ¿e for wardÅ¿hips and the dependances thereupon, as we have of late accounted, about forty five thouÅ¿and pounds by the yeare. This is a Revenue which no other King of the world hath: And as it appeares by the Statute of 14. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>It ought to be imployed in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the warres;</hi> and Å¿o doubtleÅ¿Å¿e was the firÅ¿t inÅ¿titution of the Common-Law: For the Lord hath the profit of the Wards lands to no other end, than to maintain a man in the warre during the infancy of him who otherwiÅ¿e Å¿hould Å¿erve in perÅ¿on.</p>
            <p>He hath likewiÅ¿e all forfeitures upon Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on and Outlawry, and upon penall Lawes, Fines and Amerciaments, Profits of Courts, TreaÅ¿ure-Trove, PriÅ¿age, Butlerage, Wreck, and Å¿o many more, as the very enumeration of the particulars would take up long
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:157030:15"/> time. To what other end hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law thus provided for the maintenance of the Kings charge, by all theÅ¿e wayes and meanes of raiÅ¿ing profit out of the IntereÅ¿t and property of the Subjects eÅ¿tate in lands and goods, but onely to this end, That after theÅ¿e duties paid, the poore Subject might hold and enjoy the reÅ¿t of his eÅ¿tate to his owne uÅ¿e, free and cleare from all other burdens whatÅ¿oever? To what end hath the Law given a part to the King, and left the reÅ¿t to the Subject, if that which is left be alÅ¿o at the Kings will, to make his profit thereof as he pleaÅ¿eth? To give a Å¿mall portion to him that may at his pleaÅ¿ure take more, or all, is a vain and an idle act; which Å¿hal never be imputed to a wiÅ¿e Law. But it may be objected that as the revenues are ordinary,<note place="margin">AnÅ¿were to an objection, that the King may lay ImpoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in times of extraordinary occaÅ¿ions.</note> Å¿o are they by the Law provided onely for the Å¿uÅ¿teyning of the kings ordinary charge; and that if the Law have not taken further conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and limmitted Å¿ome certain courÅ¿e, how upon Å¿udden and extraordinary occaÅ¿ions the kings charge may bee Å¿uÅ¿teined, that there is yet no reaÅ¿on Å¿hewed to the contrary, why the king may not upon Å¿uch occaÅ¿ion take Å¿ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary courÅ¿e for the rayÅ¿ing of money, as by the laying of ImpoÅ¿itions upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, or by a tax within the Realme, rather then the Common wealth for want thereof, Å¿hould periÅ¿h or be indangered.<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Hitcham.</hi>
               </note> And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the knight that laÅ¿t Å¿pake, it was held that

               <hi>upon occaÅ¿ion of a Å¿udden and unexpected war, the King may not only lay impoÅ¿itions, but levy a tax within the Realme, without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament,</hi> which poÅ¿ition in my opinion is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for to admit this were by conÅ¿equence to bring us into bondage. You Å¿ay that upon occaÅ¿ion of Å¿uddaine warre the king may levy a Tax; who Å¿hall be Judge between the king and his people of the occaÅ¿ion? can it be tryed by any Legall courÅ¿e in our Law? it cannot: if then, the king himÅ¿elfe muÅ¿t be the Å¿ole Judge in this caÅ¿e, will it not follow that the king may levie a taxe at his owne pleaÅ¿ure, Å¿eeing his pleaÅ¿ure cannot be bounded by Law? You Å¿ee into what a miÅ¿chiefe the admittance of one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath drawne you. But for a full anÅ¿wer to the objection, I Å¿ay, that the providence of the Common-Law is Å¿uch, and Å¿o excellent, as that for the defraying of the kings charge upon any occaÅ¿ions of a Å¿uddain warre, it hath, over and above all the ordinary Revenues which it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the king (which in the time of warre can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed but fall Å¿hort) made an excellent proviÅ¿ion; for (Sir) <hi>The warre muÅ¿t needs be either offenÅ¿ive or defenÅ¿ive: OffenÅ¿ive,</hi> muÅ¿t either be upon Å¿ome Nation beyond the Seas, or againÅ¿t the <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>WelÅ¿h,</hi> or other borderers within the Iland: If it be an <hi>offenÅ¿ive</hi> warre upon Å¿ome Nation beyond the Seas, it cannot be a Å¿udden Accident, for it is the kings own act; and he may, and 'tis fitting he Å¿hould take deliberation;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:157030:16"/> and if it be a juÅ¿t and neceÅ¿Å¿ary warre, he may crave, and eaÅ¿ily obtaine aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by grant of Ayd in Parliament: <hi>If an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenÅ¿ive warre upon Å¿ome of his neighbors within the Continent of this Iland,</hi> as the <hi>Scots,</hi> or the <hi>WelÅ¿h,</hi> which alÅ¿o cannot be Å¿udden or unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the king, being his own act; you know how politikely the kings of this Realme have provided, by reÅ¿erving Tenures, by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Subjects are bound to Å¿erve them in thoÅ¿e warres in perÅ¿on, at their owne charge: Only a <hi>DefenÅ¿ive warre,</hi> by invaÅ¿ion of forreign enemies, may be Å¿odain: in which caÅ¿e the Law hath not left the king to warre upon his owne expence, or to rely upon his ordinary Revenue, but hath notably provided, That every Subject within the Land, high and low, whether he hold of the king or not, in caÅ¿e of forreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaÅ¿ion may be compelled at his own charge to Å¿erve the king in perÅ¿on, as it appeares by the opinion of JuÅ¿tice <hi>Thirming,</hi> in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. The reaÅ¿on of which, in my opinion, was to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, than that the king might have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatÅ¿oever for the raiÅ¿ing of money upon his Subjects at his owne pleaÅ¿ure, without their common aÅ¿Å¿ent in Parliament. I doe then conclude this Argument, that Å¿eeing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law for maintenance of the Kings ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary charge, hath given him Å¿uch an ample Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue out of the intereÅ¿t and property of the Subject, and provided alÅ¿o for Å¿odaine occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:157030:17"/> that in Å¿o doing it hath Å¿ecluded and Å¿ecured the reÅ¿t of the Subjects eÅ¿tate from the Kings power and pleaÅ¿ure; and conÅ¿equently, that the King hath not power upon any occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at his pleaÅ¿ure to charge the eÅ¿tate of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by ImpoÅ¿itions, Tallages, or Taxes (for I hold them all in one degree) or any other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den whatÅ¿oever, without the Subjects free and voluntary aÅ¿Å¿ent, and that in Parliament: If it were otherwiÅ¿e, you Å¿ee how it were to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diÅ¿Å¿olution and deÅ¿truction of that politike frame &amp; conÅ¿titution of this Common-wealth, which I have opened unto you; and of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wiÅ¿e providence of the Common-Law, for the preÅ¿erving of property, and the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion.

I will now, according to my diviÅ¿ion, urge an Argument or two of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and preÅ¿umption; the rather, becauÅ¿e Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of this nature have been much enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by thoÅ¿e who have maintained the contrary opinion,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Bacon.</hi>
               </note> (eÅ¿pecially by Mr. Solicitor:) I call them Arguments of inference, and yet in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, thoÅ¿e which I Å¿hall urge are alÅ¿o of good proofe; Å¿uch as they are, you Å¿hall judge of them. <hi>They are drawne either from the actions or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearances of the Kings of this Realme, or, from the actions and forbearances of the people.</hi>

Is it likely, that if any or all theÅ¿e Kings had thought they had had in them any lawfull power by juÅ¿t Prerogative to have laid ImpoÅ¿itions at their pleaÅ¿ure, that they would not rather have made uÅ¿e of that, than have taken this courÅ¿e by act of Parliament, Å¿o full of delay, Å¿o prejudiciall to their Right, Å¿o Å¿ubject to the pleaÅ¿ure of their people, who never undergoe Burdens but with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:157030:18"/> murmuring and much unwillingnes: Can there be any thing more hatefull to the high Spirit of a King, than to Å¿ubject himÅ¿elfe to the pleaÅ¿ure of his people, eÅ¿pecially for matter of Reliefe, and that by way of Prayer, having lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his hands to relieve himÅ¿elfe without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beholding to them?</p>
            <p>If perhaps the Kings themÅ¿elves were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this great Prerogative, which cannot be imagined; had they not alwaies about them wiÅ¿e CounÅ¿ellors to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them, and Å¿uch as for the procuring of favor to themÅ¿elves would not have failed to have put them in minde of it? Nay, if they had known any Å¿uch lawfull Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, had they not been bound in conÅ¿cience Å¿o to have done? What an overÅ¿ight was it of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and all his CounÅ¿ell, Å¿o much to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his right in Å¿o beneficiall a Prerogative; as to Å¿uffer him upon Record, and that in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to pray for that which he might have taken out of his abÅ¿olute power? Can there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t be a more direct diÅ¿claiming in the Right, (to compare great things with leÅ¿Å¿e) if the Lord by matter of Record claime any thing of his villaine, it is a diÅ¿claimer of the villenage.</p>
            <p>The Kings of England have other noble and high Prerogatives; I will only name two of them, The making of warre and peace, and the raiÅ¿ing and abaÅ¿ing of Coyne at their pleaÅ¿ure: Did they ever crave the aÅ¿Å¿ent of their Subjects in Parliament to make a warre? Their advice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:157030:18"/> indeed they have Å¿ometimes Å¿ought, and their ayd for treaÅ¿ure to maintaine it. The Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of raiÅ¿ing and abaÅ¿ing the value of money hath been oftentimes put in practiÅ¿e by them, and Å¿ometimes Å¿trayned to Å¿uch a height, that the King might well Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Subjects could not but be much diÅ¿content therewith: And yet never any King of this Realme did it by aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent of Parliament, which perhaps Å¿ome one milde King among Å¿o many would have done, and it may be, would alÅ¿o have prayed his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to yield thereto, only to avoid the grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people, if the Å¿eeking of aÅ¿Å¿ent in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had not been thought to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the abÅ¿olute power of their SucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors: and yet, as for Å¿ome of theÅ¿e Kings, it may be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, they made little conÅ¿cience to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice a SucceÅ¿Å¿or in one point, that made no Å¿cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple totally to depoÅ¿e a PredeceÅ¿Å¿or from his Throne, and all his Regalities, and to uÅ¿urp it to themÅ¿elves.</p>
            <p>And Å¿o I proceed to my next Argument of Inference drawn from the actions of our Kings. Some of the Kings of England, as namely; <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the 2.</note> in the yeere of his Reigne, and <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in the 1. and 24. yeere of his Reigne, as may appeare by the Records here amongÅ¿t us, were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to accept an increaÅ¿e of their CuÅ¿tome <hi>by way of Loane</hi> from the Merchants, and Å¿olemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binde themÅ¿elves to repay it againe. Would any wiÅ¿e man in the world, that thought he had

If a poore man perhaps through feare might be enforced Å¿o farre to yeeld to a mighty adverÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet that a powerfull man Å¿hould Å¿toope Å¿o low to one much weaker than he; nay, that a King, in a point of Å¿uch conÅ¿equence, Å¿hould Å¿o farre diÅ¿cend from his GreatneÅ¿Å¿e, as to borrow of his poore Subject that which without being beholding to him he might obtein as his Right; and binde himÅ¿elfe to repay it againe: I Å¿ay, it cannot with any reaÅ¿on be imagined; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it muÅ¿t be concluded, that a king that Å¿hall Å¿o doe, doth not thinke that he hath Å¿o much as colour of Right to impoÅ¿e.</p>

            <p>A man would thinke, that the taking of the increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome by all the kings, both one and other, with the aÅ¿Å¿ent of their Subjects in Parliament, and Å¿ometimes by way of Prayer and Intreaty, for a Å¿hort time; nay, the taking of it by way of Loane, and binding themÅ¿elves to repay it; and that to have been done by the moÅ¿t powerfull kings, in their greateÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were Argument enough that they did not beleeve they might juÅ¿tly claime it as their right by their abÅ¿olute power.</p>
            <p>And yet is not this all: For, Å¿ome of them, by name, <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the 1.</note> did not onely take it by aÅ¿Å¿ent in Parliament, or <hi>by way of Loane,</hi> but (as one that buyes for his mony in the Market) did give for it a reall and valuable conÅ¿ideration, and that to Merchant-Å¿trangers, of whom there was more colour to demand it as a duty, than of his naturall Subjects. In proofe of which I produce <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> made <hi>Anno</hi> 31. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is recited, that in lieu of certaine liberties and immunities granted by the king to the Merchant-Å¿trangers, as alÅ¿o for the releaÅ¿e of PriÅ¿age, they granted to the king an increaÅ¿e of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:157030:20"/> CuÅ¿tom. What were all the Å¿pecial liberties that were granted them, I know not, nor whether they continue; but Å¿ure I am, that by vertue of that Grant they are at this day free of PriÅ¿age, paying onely 2<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. upon a Tun of Wine, by the name of Butlerage, which they granted by the Å¿ame Charter: whereas EngliÅ¿h-men pay PriÅ¿age <hi>in Å¿pecie, viz.</hi> One Tun before the MaÅ¿t, and one Tun behinde.</p>
            <p>And it is very worthy the obÅ¿ervation, how the Å¿ame King, <hi>E.</hi> 1. in the Å¿ame yeer of his reign did command his CuÅ¿tomers throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> That whereas certain EngliÅ¿h Merchants were, as he was informed, of their own accords willing to pay him the like increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome which the Merchant Å¿trangers had granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Å¿o as they might enjoy the like liberties and benefits; that nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e they Å¿hould not compell Å¿uch EngliÅ¿h Merchants, againÅ¿t their wils, to pay it: the words are worth the hearing: <hi>Cum quidam Mercatores de regno &amp; poteÅ¿tate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tri, ut ipÅ¿i dictis libertat.</hi> (having before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Charta Mercatoria) uti &amp; gandere, &amp; de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿is naÅ¿tris quieti eÅ¿Å¿e poÅ¿Å¿int; praeÅ¿tationes &amp; Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tumas hujuÅ¿modi, de bonis &amp; mercandizis Å¿uis nobis dare &amp; Å¿olvere velint; ut accepimus, aÅ¿Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navimus vos ad praeÅ¿tationes &amp; CuÅ¿tumas prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictas, de his qui praeÅ¿tationes &amp; CuÅ¿tumasillas gratanter &amp; abÅ¿que cohercione Å¿olvere volnerint, colligendum, &amp; ad opus noÅ¿trum recipiendum; ita tamen quod aliquem Mercatorem de dicto Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no

            <p>One other obÅ¿ervation I draw from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the kings touching the increaÅ¿e of their cuÅ¿tome, which is this, that thoÅ¿e kings which did lay ImpoÅ¿itions (which as I will Å¿hew you by and by, was very rarely) though it were never but in time of great neceÅ¿Å¿ity, and but to indure for a Å¿hort time; yet they alwayes did it, not with the advice alone of the Merchants, as at this day, but <hi>the Merchants did alwaies Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly grant an increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome;</hi> and the kings were alwayes wary, for the better juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their actions to the people, in their CommiÅ¿Å¿ions for collecting of CuÅ¿tome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite not onely the great neceÅ¿Å¿ity which moved them to take an increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome, but alÅ¿o <hi>the grant of the Merchants,</hi> as may appeare by the Records, of which we have the copies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t us; I dare confidently Å¿ay, there is not above one or two at the moÅ¿t that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, if the ImpoÅ¿itions be of that nature which

            </p>
            <p>Hitherto I have, according to my diviÅ¿ion, drawne Arguments from that which our Kings have done, and put in practiÅ¿e for the increaÅ¿e of their CuÅ¿tome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will now make Å¿ome obÅ¿ervations of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,</hi>

            <p>FirÅ¿t therefore in generall, I obÅ¿erve, that from the ConqueÅ¿t, untill the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> being no leÅ¿Å¿e then 480. yeeres Å¿pace, (whatÅ¿oever the occaÅ¿ions were) whatÅ¿oever the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the Kings were, yet in the practiÅ¿e of this pretended Prerogative of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:157030:22"/> ImpoÅ¿ing the Kings have been Å¿o Å¿paring, as notwithÅ¿tanding, this curious Å¿earch, that hath been made (wherein I Å¿uppoÅ¿e nothing that might make for the cleering of the QueÅ¿tion, hath eÅ¿caped us) it cannot be found or proved by matter of Record, that Å¿ix ImpoÅ¿itions (Å¿uch as we now complaine of) were laid by all thoÅ¿e Kings (who were in number 22. And thoÅ¿e Å¿ixe (if they were Å¿o many) though they were unlawfull, yet were they in Å¿ome Å¿ort to be born withall. FirÅ¿t, by reaÅ¿on they were very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; Secondly, that they were laid in the times of great and apparant neceÅ¿Å¿itie, and that they were to endure but for a yeer or two; For none of them, except onely that upon Wine, laid 16. <hi>E.</hi> 1. laÅ¿ted longer. They were (I Å¿ay) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding their unlawfulneÅ¿Å¿e) yet in theÅ¿e other reÅ¿pects, Å¿o farre to be borne withall, as if the impoÅ¿itions which are now laid, had been Å¿o qualified, we Å¿hould I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, never have complained of them; and yet not one of theÅ¿e few impoÅ¿itions laid in former times, but was complained of, and upon complaint taken away, as may appear by the Records here amongÅ¿t us: How much more reaÅ¿on is there then, that we Å¿hould expect the like JuÅ¿tice now? conÅ¿idering that not one MerchandiÅ¿e alone, as then, but very neere all the Å¿orts and Å¿everall kindes of MerchandiÅ¿es that are, are charged; that not a moderate and eaÅ¿y charge is laid upon them, but Å¿uch, as though we Å¿hould confeÅ¿Å¿e his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ties
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:157030:23"/> abÅ¿olut power, to lay what he liÅ¿t, yet we had juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to complain of the exceÅ¿Å¿iveneÅ¿Å¿e of the Burden: For firÅ¿t, the rates of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, for the SubÅ¿idies of Poundage and Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, are extreamly rayÅ¿ed (a thing alÅ¿o though lawfull, yet hath been rarely put in practiÅ¿e) then comes the ImpoÅ¿t upon the back of that, and is as much as the SubÅ¿idie it Å¿elfe is; in Å¿ome few MerchandiÅ¿es, 'tis true, the ImpoÅ¿t is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps leÅ¿Å¿e then the SubÅ¿idy, but 'tis as true, that in divers others, the ImpoÅ¿t is farre more. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, theÅ¿e ImpoÅ¿itions were not laid in the time of warre, but even then when we were at peace with all the world, except perhaps there were Å¿ome Å¿parks of Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then not fully quenched. LaÅ¿tly theÅ¿e ImpoÅ¿itions are not (as thoÅ¿e in former time were) limited to endure for a yeere or two, but are to come to his MajeÅ¿tie, his Heires and SucceÅ¿Å¿ors for ever, as may appeare by his MajeÅ¿ties Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in print, prefixed before the new book of Rates. So as if thoÅ¿e few ImpoÅ¿itions laid in former times, had been lawfull, yet can they not by any means be a warrant or preÅ¿ident for our preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions, differing Å¿o far from them in all theÅ¿e points of conÅ¿equence. But if even thoÅ¿e few, Å¿o quallified as they were, were complained of and taken away, what Å¿hall we then Å¿ay of ours, Å¿o farre exceeding them in all the degrees of Irregularitie; BeÅ¿ides, if Å¿o few PreÅ¿idents, as five or Å¿ix in Å¿o many yeers Å¿pace,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:157030:23"/> and thoÅ¿e in times of Å¿o great neceÅ¿Å¿itie, without any expreÅ¿Å¿e Judgment in Law; or good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in approbation of them, but accompanied with as many complaints againÅ¿t them, be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument enough to prove the lawfulneÅ¿Å¿e of the act, I dare undertake, that as well taxes within the land, as ImpoÅ¿itions upon Merchandizes may be proved to be lawfull: But to alledge the acts of kings, in rayÅ¿ing a profit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves upon their Subjects, to prove thereby their right, is of all other arguments that are, the weakeÅ¿t, and Å¿o I leave it, and call to minde, that when I told you, it could not be proved by the Records amongÅ¿t us, that from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t to Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, there had been any more then Å¿ixe ImpoÅ¿itions laid; I did in that number, limit my Å¿elfe to Å¿uch ImpoÅ¿itions as thoÅ¿e are which we now complain of, for I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e, that in that Å¿pace, many more Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions were laid, but they were of a farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nature from ours, differing I Å¿ay, not only in thoÅ¿e circumÅ¿tances, by which I did even now compare the ImpoÅ¿itions of theÅ¿e times to thoÅ¿e five or Å¿ix of former ages, but in very eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence and propertie, inÅ¿omuch as they may not properly be called ImpoÅ¿itions, and yet the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practiÅ¿e of them hath been objected and relyed upon, as Å¿o many PreÅ¿idents, to prove the lawfulneÅ¿Å¿e of the ImpoÅ¿itions now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned of: It behoveth me therefore, that in maintenance of my aÅ¿Å¿ertion, that Å¿o few Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:157030:24"/> have been laid, as I have affirmed, that I open unto you the difference betweene the one and the other, which being done, your Å¿elves will eaÅ¿ily judge that the greater part make nothing towards the defence of theÅ¿e preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions; For theÅ¿e ImpoÅ¿itions which now are in queÅ¿tion, are no other then an increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome, at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, and commanded by him to be taken, the paÅ¿Å¿age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free and open to all men. ThoÅ¿e other which make Å¿uch a great Å¿hew in number, and are produced as Å¿o many PreÅ¿idents in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of theÅ¿e, are no other then Å¿o many DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ations or Licences for money, to paÅ¿Å¿e with Merchandizes prohibited by Act of Parliament to be exported, as will evidently appeare by comparing the times, and examining the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. I will therefore in this place, as Å¿hortly as I can, runne over thoÅ¿e PreÅ¿idents that have been, or may be alledged by the contrary part, out of thoÅ¿e Records which are here amongÅ¿t us, and leave it to your judgement, whether I maintaine my aÅ¿Å¿ertion, or be not rather better then my word for the number.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿ition by them alledged,<note place="margin">Urged by <hi>Flem. Clark. Doderig.</hi>
               </note> is that of 16. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. which as it appears by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, was 4. Å¿hillings upon a Tun of Wine. This indeed, for ought I know to the contrary, was a meere ImpoÅ¿ition, Å¿uch as are now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion; and yet if I did deny it, and Å¿ay that it was layd by aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament, I know not how
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:157030:24"/> the contrary could be proved, for though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the words of the Record are (<hi>Cum Rex precipiÅ¿Å¿et, ut de Å¿ingulis doliis vini caperentur</hi> 4. <hi>Å¿olidi</hi>) it follows not that it was laid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only by the kings commandment, for we Å¿ee that even Å¿ome Acts of Parliament, in thoÅ¿e auncient times, though they were made by the full aÅ¿Å¿ent of all the three EÅ¿tates, yet they have theÅ¿e words in their preambles, <hi>(Rex precepit: Rex vult.)</hi> But as for Recitalls of Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by the King, in his CommiÅ¿Å¿ions, and otherwiÅ¿e, it was in thoÅ¿e times uÅ¿uall to Å¿ay, <hi>(Cum nuper ordinaverimus)</hi> and therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding the Recitall be <hi>(Cum nuper Rex precipiÅ¿Å¿et)</hi> it is no cleere proof, that therefore it was done onely by the Kings Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e I will, I Å¿ay, admit this to be a meere ImpoÅ¿ition, and to be one of the number, and indeed, as this is the firÅ¿t they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, Å¿o is it their beÅ¿t, only this (amongÅ¿t all the reÅ¿t) is not limited to indure for a time certain: but give me leave (I beÅ¿eech you) to open unto you, with what circumÅ¿tances this ImpoÅ¿ition was accompanied, and what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, and then I will leave you to judge (who beÅ¿t are able) how far the preÅ¿ent Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions may be juÅ¿tifyed by this; The firÅ¿t cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance to be obÅ¿erved in this ImpoÅ¿ition, is that it was laid immediately after the warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t <hi>Wales</hi> was ended, and at the time, when for the Å¿elling of the EÅ¿tate of <hi>GaÅ¿coigne,</hi> the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:157030:25"/> king himÅ¿elf was in perÅ¿on enforced to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a voyage thither, as may appeare by our HiÅ¿tories of thoÅ¿e times, which alÅ¿o may bee collected by the very words of the record which are theÅ¿e, <hi>Cum Rex ante ultimum ReceÅ¿Å¿um Å¿uum ab Anglia precepiÅ¿set, &amp;c.</hi> That as theÅ¿e times were troubleÅ¿ome, they were alÅ¿o very chargeable to the king, and did put him to try all meanes for the levying of money, I Å¿hall not need to urge it, it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>One other circumÅ¿tance is this, that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition laid in this time of great neceÅ¿Å¿ity was not, as now, upon all Merchandizes, nor Å¿o much as in generall upon one kinde of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, comming from all the parts of the world, but onely upon Å¿uch wines as were brought hither from two Towns in <hi>GaÅ¿coigne, Bergerac.</hi> and <hi>St. Emilians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">16. E. 1.22.

            <p>Another circumÅ¿tance is this, that though that this ImpoÅ¿ition were indeed laid without limitation of any time, as touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof, yet within Å¿ix years follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> 5. <hi>Decemb. a.</hi> 22. upon complaint of the Merchants the king releaÅ¿ed two Å¿hillings of the foure Å¿hillings, as may appear by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:157030:25"/> of 22 <hi>E.</hi> 1. with which the Merchants not holding themÅ¿elves contented, the very Å¿ame yeare within eight or nine months follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> 23. <hi>Juliian.</hi> 22. the whole ImpoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was releaÅ¿ed, as may appeare by a recitall in the accompt of one <hi>William Randall</hi> receiver of the ImpoÅ¿t money entred, <hi>an.</hi> 26 <hi>E.</hi> 1. And within three years after the releaÅ¿e, <hi>viz, an.</hi> 25. there followed an act of Parliament againÅ¿t all ImpoÅ¿itions in generall, as when I come to Å¿hew you what Statutes there are, in the point, I Å¿hall I hope cleerly prove unto you; In the meane time I will proceed to examine the reÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>The next preÅ¿ident urged is an impoÅ¿ition of 40. Å¿hillings upon a Å¿ack of wooll laid by <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>an.</hi> 21. For the proofe of which, a record of the Exchequer of that year hath been vouched. I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e I have not Å¿een that Record, but by another Record of the Å¿ame Court, <hi>an.</hi> 26. <hi>E.</hi> 1. it is evident that the Å¿aid ImpoÅ¿ition was not raiÅ¿ed by the kings abÅ¿olute power, but by grant, and that alÅ¿o the Å¿ame was in the time of warre, and to endure but two or three yeare, if the warre Å¿hould Å¿o long continue, as will beÅ¿t appear by the words of the Record. <hi>Cum cuÅ¿tuma</hi> 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>

            <p> By this you perceive, by what means, upon what occaÅ¿ion, and with what limittation this impoÅ¿ition was laid: if you will further know, what followed of it, May it pleaÅ¿e you to read the Printed Statute of <hi>an.</hi> 21. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7. where it is Å¿aid that the more part of the Commonalty found themÅ¿elves Å¿ore agreeved therewithall; And by the Å¿ame Statute, not only that impoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 40. Å¿hillings upon a Å¿ack of wooll, which was the occaÅ¿ion of the great grief &amp; complaint was taken away; but upon occaÅ¿ion thereof, there was at the Å¿ame time proviÅ¿ion alÅ¿o made, againÅ¿t all other impoÅ¿itions whatÅ¿oever, as I Å¿ay, I hope I Å¿hall anon cleerly prove unto you, InÅ¿omuch as this impoÅ¿ition of 40. Å¿hillings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Å¿ack of wooll, ought to be Å¿o farre from being urged as a preÅ¿ident for the preÅ¿ent impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition and conÅ¿equently of the grievance of the Common wealth which followes thereupon, as that rather on the contrary part it may be thought to be the happieÅ¿t accident in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equence thereof, that ever befell the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth in this kinde. For it was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion of the making of the firÅ¿t law that ever was made againÅ¿t impoÅ¿itions, and other charges and burdens of that nature to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed by the kings abÅ¿olute power without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And Å¿o I leave their Å¿econd PreÅ¿ident,<note place="margin">Vouched by <hi>Fleming, Clark, Dodderidge, Bacon, Attorny Hobart.</hi>
               </note> and come to the third, which in time was 31. <hi>of the Å¿ame King E.</hi> 1. It is no other then that increaÅ¿e
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:157030:26"/> of CuÅ¿tome, which by the Merchant Å¿trangers was granted to king <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. by that Charter now familiarly known unto us by the name of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Mercatoria,</hi> which by all that have maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his MajeÅ¿ties right to impoÅ¿e, hath been Å¿tood upon and urged, as an impoÅ¿ition by the kings abÅ¿olute power; but more eÅ¿pecially hath MaÅ¿ter <hi>Solicitor</hi> been Å¿trongly inforced with all the advantage poÅ¿Å¿ible for the maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his opinion. NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e I doubt not but I Å¿hall give it a very full anÅ¿wer, Å¿uch as yet this objection hath not received, though divers that have Å¿poken before, and Å¿ome this day, have undertaken to cleere it; wherein I will arrogate nothing to my Å¿elfe, but leave it wholly to your cenÅ¿ure. It hath been Å¿aid by MaÅ¿ter <hi>Solicitor,</hi> that though this increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome may Å¿eem to Å¿ome, to proceed from the grant of Merchants, yet that this grant of theirs was to no other purpoÅ¿e, nor had other effect, then only thereby to declare their aÅ¿Å¿ent; For that, that thoÅ¿e which did grant were no Corporation or body in the eÅ¿timation of Law, and Å¿o could not binde any but themÅ¿elves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not Å¿uch as Å¿hould Å¿ucceed them. And that it was only the authority of the kings pleaÅ¿ure to accept and take this increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome that gave it life at the firÅ¿t and Å¿trength to continue as an ImpoÅ¿ition till this very day. For <hi>even at this day Å¿aith he, the 3. pence upon the pound granted by the Å¿aid Charter, is paid
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:157030:27"/> by the Merchants Å¿trangers, and they likewiÅ¿e en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Å¿ome priviledges granted by the Å¿aid Charter.</hi> And it was further by him obÅ¿erved; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding all the Statutes that have been ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againÅ¿t impoÅ¿itions, yet this impoÅ¿ition hath continually Å¿tood and hath never been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be paid by any man; And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is likely that no man till now ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that theÅ¿e Statutes were made againÅ¿t im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions upon Merchandizes, but were rather to be underÅ¿tood to extend onely to impoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the Realme.</p>
            <p>To this objection,<note place="margin">27. E. 3. No. 27 13 E. 3. c. 26.</note> I make this AnÅ¿wer, that it is indeed true, that the grant of Merchants in this caÅ¿e, cannot binde the whole Common wealth; as I have heretofore proved by the Petition exhibited in Parliament by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>No.</hi> 27. and by a Statute of 36 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 26. And therefore I cannot but confeÅ¿Å¿e that this increaÅ¿e of cuÅ¿tome may very truely be called an impoÅ¿ition, For that indeed it did at firÅ¿t take Å¿trength, onely by the kings pleaÅ¿ure to accept it (as hath been Å¿aid) and not by the grant of the Merchants, admitting it therefore to be a meer impoÅ¿ition; Let us conÅ¿ider with what extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances it is accompanied.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t (as you may perceive by the Record it Å¿elf, and as it hath partly been Å¿aid already, the King took it not without yeelding recompence for it; For the Merchants Å¿trangers, by Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:157030:27"/> themÅ¿elves unto this charge, obtained divers liberties and immunities from the King, by the Å¿ame Charter, amongÅ¿t which freedome from PriÅ¿age is one which at this day they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, In which reÅ¿pect this impoÅ¿ition is in Å¿ome Å¿ort tollerable, though not at all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Another conÅ¿iderable circumÅ¿tance, and difference from our preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions is this, that it was a compoÅ¿ition made by the King with Merchant Å¿trangers, which though it be by Å¿trictneÅ¿Å¿e of our common law, not of force to binde in perpetuitie; yet how farre by the Civill Law this doth binde Å¿tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which are governed by theÅ¿e lawes, is not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily decided, and this may be a good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to uphold it.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e Å¿peciall reaÅ¿ons, though they may well Å¿erve the turne, to make an evident difference betwixt this, and our preÅ¿ent impoÅ¿itions, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently to avoid the concluÅ¿ion, drawn from the PreÅ¿ident, and may alÅ¿o Å¿eem colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and particular reaÅ¿ons to uphold the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition it Å¿elf; yet is not this that which I mean to relie upon for AnÅ¿wer; For even this ImpoÅ¿ition, in recompence of which the King parted with Å¿o large priviledges and benefits, and which becauÅ¿e it concerned only merchant Å¿trangers, did neither in the burden thereof, nor in the preÅ¿ident, Å¿o directly touch the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> yet in the deteÅ¿tation, as it Å¿eems of all impoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:157030:28"/> of what nature or kiude Å¿oever, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what pretext or colour Å¿oever they were grounded, I Å¿ay, even this impoÅ¿ition alÅ¿o was complained of in Parliament within few yeeres following; and upon complaint, taken away, as may appeare by the cloÅ¿e Roll of 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana</hi> 23. Where you Å¿hall finde inrolled a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿ede as,</hi> commanding that the new CuÅ¿tome, granted by the Merchant Å¿trangers (reciting the particulars, as they are contained in <hi>Charta Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoria)</hi> Å¿hall ceaÅ¿e at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, and this is there Å¿aid to be yeelded to at the requeÅ¿t of the Commons which cannot be but in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but becauÅ¿e the renewing of it again reÅ¿ted at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, therefore within two yeeres after, by a publike Ordinance made by the principall Prelates, Earles and Barons, and other great men of the Kingdome, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ed by the Kings CommiÅ¿Å¿ion, dated the 16. of <hi>May,</hi> the Å¿ame third yeere of his reigne, the Charter it Å¿elfe was declared to be utterly void, For that it was hurtfull to the Commonwealth, againÅ¿t <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and made <hi>without aÅ¿Å¿ent in Parliament;</hi> and not only that Charter, but all other new CuÅ¿tomes or ImpoÅ¿itions whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, impoÅ¿ed Å¿ince the Coronation of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. till that time were alÅ¿o taken away, Å¿aving one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the old cuÅ¿tome upon Wooll, Wooll-felts, and Leather, And further it was ordained, That if any man Å¿hould preÅ¿ume <hi>to take</hi> any more then the auncient cuÅ¿tom rightfully due,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:157030:28"/> and Å¿hould be thereof convict, he Å¿hould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿were to the partie greeved his CoÅ¿ts and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, be impriÅ¿oned according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his offence, and be further puniÅ¿hed, as an offender againÅ¿t <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> according to the diÅ¿cretion of the JuÅ¿tices. <hi>Ro. ordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>in the Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the force and authoritie of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, may perhaps be doubted and blemiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauÅ¿e it was made by the Barons, at the time when they had the better hand of the King, as hath been in part objected, yet you Å¿ee that they deliver not their cenÅ¿ures, without alledging alÅ¿o their reaÅ¿ons;<note place="margin">37. E. 3.20.</note> and this their Ordinance is no more in effect, then that which was thought fit by all the Commons in the Parliament of 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>But it hath been yet further Å¿aid, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding this Ordinance, the impoÅ¿ition doth nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e continue in force, and is at this day paid by the Merchant Å¿trangers, and that therefore in likely hood, the ordinance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not againÅ¿t it. Tis true that at this day the Merchant Å¿tranger doth pay three pence more in the pound for SubÅ¿idie of poundage, then the EngliÅ¿h doth, and that by vertue of <hi>Charta Mercatoria:</hi> But let me tell you that <hi>Charta Mercatoria</hi> in it Å¿elfe, had not Å¿trength and vertue Å¿ufficient to Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t for Å¿o long a time: It was as I have Å¿aid Å¿uÅ¿pended by the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:157030:29"/> 
               <hi>an.</hi> 3. condemned by the ordinance of 5 <hi>E.</hi> 2 and had at this day been of no more force, then it was all the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. after 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that is, of none at all; had it not been confirmed by act of Parliament <hi>an.</hi> 36. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> This was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which protected <hi>Charta Mercatoria</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t all thoÅ¿e Statutes made againÅ¿t impoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that hath kept it in life till this day; And this indeed (I mean an act of Parliament) is the only means that our Law acknowledgeth, for the laying or eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of impoÅ¿itions, and without which they cannot long laÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>You have now heard opened three of thoÅ¿e Å¿ix preÅ¿idents, which are moÅ¿t relied upon for mantenance of theÅ¿e preÅ¿ent impoÅ¿itions which are all that have been urged, or can be found to have been practiÅ¿ed from the ConqueÅ¿t till the reigne of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. during which time there are as you Å¿ee, as many publique acts in oppoÅ¿ition of them, which are of Å¿o much the more force in that they are the Legall regular Acts of great CounÅ¿ells, whereas on the contrary part, thoÅ¿e three impoÅ¿itions were the acts of powerfull Kings wills, in the times of extream neceÅ¿Å¿ity, As for <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Edw. 2.</note> his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿or, there hath not been one ImpoÅ¿ition alledged to have been laid by him of one kinde or other. Nay all the records touching this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e found in his time being onely foure make directly againÅ¿t them.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t is <hi>anno</hi> 3. which was (as you have heard) a releaÅ¿e at the Kings will, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:157030:29"/> of the Commons, of the ImpoÅ¿itions raiÅ¿ed by <hi>Charta Mercatoria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Å¿econd was the Ordinance made <hi>an.</hi> 5. declaring <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> and all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions to be void, and inflicting puniÅ¿hment upon Å¿uch as Å¿hould demand any.</p>
            <p>The third was, <hi>an.</hi> 11. which is a <hi>SuperÅ¿ede as</hi> to diÅ¿charge certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>modities from yeelding an increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome granted by Merchants, by way of loane, which in great probability the King would never have releaÅ¿ed, but upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; the rather I think Å¿o, becauÅ¿e as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord recites, it was granted in a time of great neceÅ¿Å¿ity.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, <hi>anno</hi> 12. and is much of the Å¿ame nature, the recitall of which containes Å¿ome very obÅ¿ervable things, which I will open unto you: It Å¿hewes firÅ¿t in very effectuall words the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of the Kings wants, and the cauÅ¿es thereof, the words are, <hi>Cum pro ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditione guerrae noÅ¿trae Scotiae, &amp; aliis arduis neceÅ¿Å¿itatibus nobis multipliciter incumbentibus, pro quarum exoneratione quaÅ¿i infinitam pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam profundere oportebit, pecunia plurimum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeamus in preÅ¿enti; ac inÅ¿uper, pro eo quod exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Regni &amp; terrae noÅ¿trae Å¿imul cum pecunia nobis in Å¿ubventionem praemiÅ¿Å¿orum tam pro Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quam pro Comunitatem Regni noÅ¿tri conceÅ¿Å¿a ad Å¿umptus predictos cum feÅ¿tinationem qua ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediret faciend. non Å¿ufficiunt:</hi> Here was cauÅ¿e, (if any cauÅ¿e may poÅ¿Å¿ibly be juÅ¿t) for the King
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:157030:30"/> preÅ¿ently to put in practiÅ¿e his Prerogative of ImpoÅ¿itions, his expence by reaÅ¿on of a neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary Warre in <hi>Scotland</hi> was Å¿o great, as the whole Revenue of the kingdome, together with an ayd which had been lately granted him, could not with that expedition that was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ite Å¿upply his preÅ¿ent want, doth hee for all this make uÅ¿e of his Prerogative of impoÅ¿ing? or doth hee haÅ¿tily for want of adviÅ¿ed procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, take Å¿ome other courÅ¿e prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to his right? No, the record further Å¿ayes, that he enquired by all wayes and meanes how he might moÅ¿t commodiouÅ¿ly and fitly levy money for theÅ¿e occaÅ¿ions. After which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ed deliberation, the courÅ¿e at laÅ¿t reÅ¿olved upon, was not by abÅ¿olute power to lay Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions, which of all other courÅ¿es (if it had been lawfull, had been the moÅ¿t Å¿peedy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall) but a courÅ¿e more juÅ¿tifiable; which was, that Merchants Å¿hould be called together, and that they Å¿hould be intreated to lend the King upon every Å¿ack of wooll 10. Å¿hillings and upon every laÅ¿t of Lether 5. Å¿hillings, above the ancient cuÅ¿tome, and that for their Å¿ecurity of true repayment, <hi>without fiction or delay,</hi> which are the words of the Record, (whereby it Å¿eems that onely a pretence of a Loane and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment had been before that time uÅ¿ed to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ImpoÅ¿itions, commandment Å¿hould be given to the CuÅ¿tomers to certifie into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, the names of every particular Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:157030:30"/> that Å¿hould Å¿o lend unto the King, that they might accordingly receive full Å¿atisfaction. And tis worth the obÅ¿erving, that this Loane was for no longer time, Then from Aprill, till October following; thus much is warranted by the Record: So as you Å¿ee that in all this time of this <hi>King, Ed.</hi> 2. ImpoÅ¿itions were not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together forborn even in the times of his greateÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ity, but they were alÅ¿o condemned as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿t and utterly unlawfull.</p>
            <p>We come now to the reigne of <hi>King Ed.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Ed. 3.</note> in whoÅ¿e time there was no practiÅ¿e or meanes, that by the policy of man could be thought on to bring the people under this yoke of ImpoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament, but it was by him attempted: InÅ¿omuch, as I have in my obÅ¿ervation out of the Records collected no leÅ¿Å¿e then five or Å¿ix Å¿everall waies all of them very colourable, which in his time were put in practiÅ¿e for the raiÅ¿ing of impoÅ¿itions, and yet none of them but was reÅ¿iÅ¿ted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and condemned.</p>
            <p>That which was moÅ¿t uÅ¿uall with him was that Merchants Å¿hould grant to pay him Å¿o much upon every Commodity exported or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by way of increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome;<note place="margin">ImpoÅ¿itions by way of Grant of Merchants.</note> this Å¿eems not unreaÅ¿onable, for that every man might grant of his own what he liÅ¿ted, and this alÅ¿o to make it more colourable was never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but in the time of warre: And yet as it hath been pastly Å¿aid already, this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:157030:35"/> alÅ¿o for other offences, yet the laying of theÅ¿e to their charge, did Å¿hew the great hate generally conceived againÅ¿t impoÅ¿itions of this kinde; I might here further adde in proofe of the invalidity of theÅ¿e DiÅ¿penÅ¿ations, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Merchants having obtained Å¿ome of theÅ¿e, and having alÅ¿o the advantage of the Kings Proclamation to diÅ¿penÅ¿e with the Statute, which reÅ¿trained their paÅ¿Å¿age, yet they never thought themÅ¿elves Å¿ecure from ths puniÅ¿hment of the Statute, till they were provided for by Act of Parliament, as may appeare by a Statute printed, <hi>anno</hi> 35 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. To alledge therefore any of this kind, thereby to prove the lawfulnes of ours cannot but argue a weak cauÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>For firÅ¿t (as I have Å¿aid) there is farre more reaÅ¿on and colour for theÅ¿e, then for ours; for in this caÅ¿e no man was compelled to pay, that did it not to avoide a greater miÅ¿cheife, for by paying the ImpoÅ¿ition, he was free from a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veous puniÅ¿hment for breach of a penall Law, which reÅ¿trained his paÅ¿Å¿age; whereas in our caÅ¿e a charge is laid upon him for exerciÅ¿ing his lawfull Trade, where no Statute Law, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law is to the contrary, but rather both the one and the other make for him.</p>
            <p>But it may bee here objected, that the King may Lawfully reÅ¿traine, the breach of which reÅ¿traint, is a contempt and againÅ¿t Law, and that to impoÅ¿e doth imply a reÅ¿traint upon a penalty. SuppoÅ¿e it were Å¿o, yet if in caÅ¿e where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:157030:35"/> the reÅ¿traint is not onely by the King, but the whole EÅ¿tate aÅ¿Å¿embled in Parliament, for Å¿ome urgent cauÅ¿e it be unlawfull to give LicenÅ¿e for money (as you perceive it is) how much more is it Å¿o, where the reÅ¿traint is for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e then to raiÅ¿e an impoÅ¿ition as in our caÅ¿e; but of this more largely hereafter.</p>
            <p>Another deviÅ¿e of raiÅ¿ing impoÅ¿itions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aÅ¿Å¿ent of the Commons in Parliament,<note place="margin">ImpoÅ¿itions raiÅ¿ed by way of Ordinance in Parliament</note> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿ed by <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was <hi>by way of Ordinance,</hi> which indeed is in the next degree of Å¿trength unto a Statute. For it is a ConÅ¿titution made by the king himÅ¿elfe, and all the Prelates, Earls, and Barons, not at the CounÅ¿ell Table, or in the Kings Chamber; but Å¿itting Å¿olemnly in Parliament, and hath alÅ¿o the like Å¿olemnity of inrolement that a Statute hath, onely it is enrolled in a Roll by it Å¿elfe, which hath the name of the Roll of the Ordinances; But the only eÅ¿Å¿entiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this and an Act of Parliament, is, that this hath not the aÅ¿Å¿ent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>Some Ordinances have had that eÅ¿timation amongÅ¿t us, that they have at this day; the force of Statutes as the Ordinance of <hi>Merton,</hi> made 20 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. (which though it were no other then an Ordinance made by the King, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Earls, and Barons, without aÅ¿Å¿ent of the Commons, yet hath it by continuance of time gotten not onely the Å¿trength, but the name alÅ¿o of a Statute. There be Å¿ome others of this by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:157030:36"/> nature, and we finde it uÅ¿uall, that the names of Statutes and Ordinances, have been Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and confuÅ¿edly uÅ¿ed, to expreÅ¿Å¿e the one or the other. So as there was not any other more probable deviÅ¿e or invention to have brought the people under the yoake of ImpoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without their own aÅ¿Å¿ent, then was this, by the way of Ordinance; Nay to adde yet a further Å¿trength to this high authority of an Ordinance in Parliament, the aÅ¿Å¿ent alÅ¿o of Merchants was uÅ¿ually joyned therewithall, to make it have the cleerer paÅ¿Å¿age with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and further it was never, but in the time of warre.</p>

            <p>There was yet another Device for raiÅ¿ing of ImpoÅ¿itions (begun indeed by <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">ImpoÅ¿itions raiÅ¿ed by grant of Merchants, for Liberties granted to them.</note> but revived, and much practiÅ¿ed by <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which was alÅ¿o by way of grant of Merchants, and yet not altogether the Å¿ame that I firÅ¿t obÅ¿erved to have been Å¿o much practiÅ¿ed by <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. but is much more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable and tollerable. For whereas that was a grant, or rather a meere guift, without any thing granted back againe in lieu thereof; this I now Å¿peake of, is a Å¿olemne grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, made by Merchants, of an increaÅ¿e of cuÅ¿tome, for liberties and freedoms, and other valuable priviledges, and exemptions, granted unto them by the King: that former was, <hi>date nihil expectantes;</hi> this is, <hi>date &amp; dabitur vobis,</hi> and indeed the recompence that the Merchants had by this Charter granted unto them, made their grant to the King leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ubject to controll, then otherwiÅ¿e without Å¿uch recompence it would have been; I mean the grant of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Å¿trangers, Å¿o often remembred amongÅ¿t us, by the name of <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> which though it were damned all the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:157030:38"/> from the third yeer of his reign, yet was it revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>E.</hi> 3. (<hi>Even that very yeer, when he likewiÅ¿e depoÅ¿ed the King his father,</hi> and uÅ¿urped to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe his Crown.)For it appeares by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that he commanded the Å¿ame to be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very firÅ¿t yeere of his Reigne.<note place="margin">1. Ed. 3. Ro. Fin.</note> What hath been Å¿aid againÅ¿t this kind of ImpoÅ¿ition, I Å¿hall not need here againe to repeate, only let me call to your remembrance, how this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as needing a better prop then his owne Å¿trength, and Validity in Law, was in the Å¿ame Kings Reigne confirmed by Parliament, and onely by that Å¿trength continueth in force at this day.</p>
            <p>You have heard five or Å¿ixe Å¿everall politique Inventions and DeviÅ¿es for the eaÅ¿ie drawing on, and Å¿weetning of this yoak of ImpoÅ¿itions, all practiÅ¿ed by this prudent and potent King, <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. whoÅ¿e times were indeed Å¿o troubleÅ¿om, and his charge every way Å¿o exceÅ¿Å¿ive, as it is no marvell, that he left not any way unattempted, to raiÅ¿e money, without the aÅ¿Å¿ent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whom he always found unwillingly and hardly drawne to matters of charge.</p>
            <p>One other way of ImpoÅ¿itions he uÅ¿ed,<note place="margin">ImpoÅ¿itions laid by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿e and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> not coloured or masked under any Å¿uch pretence, or politick Invention, as you have heard, but plain and direct, only his owne expreÅ¿Å¿e command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Officers, to collect of every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Å¿o much for Å¿uch a commoditie, exported or imported, and to anÅ¿were it into his Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:157030:38"/> without any recitall in his CommiÅ¿Å¿ions, of Grant, AÅ¿Å¿ent, Guift, Loane of Merchants, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿penÅ¿ation, or Ordinance in Parliament, or any other Å¿uch colourable pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e indeed, and onely theÅ¿e are meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions, and may be aptly compared with theÅ¿e of our times; Of this kind, amongÅ¿t all the Records of <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time, I finde on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two, which I will truly open unto you; The firÅ¿t is in the Twenty one of his Reigne, where it appears that <hi>Lionell</hi> afterwards <hi>Duke of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> named upon the Record,<note place="margin">21. Ed. 3 no 11 Ro. Parliam.</note> 
               <hi>Lionell of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> becauÅ¿e I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, he was there borne, the Kings Å¿econd Å¿onne being then Guardian of <hi>England,</hi> whileÅ¿t the King his father was at the Å¿iege of <hi>Callice,</hi> at a counÅ¿ell by him held the Å¿ame yeere, which I take to be no other then the Privie CounÅ¿ell, aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament, upon every Å¿ack of Wooll Two Shillings, upon every Tun of Wine Two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, upon every Pound of Aver de poys of Merchandizes imported,<note place="margin">Poundage impoÅ¿ed.</note> Sixe pence. This ImpoÅ¿ition was, I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e (for ought I know to the contrary) Å¿uch as our preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions are, I meane, in that it was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed onely, and Å¿imply by the Kings abÅ¿olute power, and may in that reÅ¿pect be the Fourth (of that number of Sixe) which I told you were all that could be found in any degree like to ours, ever to have been practiÅ¿ed in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:157030:39"/> from the ConqueÅ¿t, till Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time. But though in the authoritie of impoÅ¿ing, it be like, yet in circumÅ¿tances very materiall, you Å¿hall finde an apparant difference between them.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, this ImpoÅ¿ition is very moderate in the Å¿um, as you may perceive, for it was but Two Shillings upon a Å¿ack, whereas in 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. forty Shillings upon a Å¿ack of wooll was uÅ¿uall, and Å¿ometimes fifty Å¿hillings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was to continue no longer then till Michaelmas following.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was laid in the time of a moÅ¿t chargeable warre, and ordained to be imployed for the maintenance of Ships of warre at Sea, for the Å¿afeguard of Merchants in their paÅ¿Å¿age, of which it is apparant, there was at this inÅ¿tant very great neceÅ¿Å¿itie; for it was (as I have Å¿aid) impoÅ¿ed then, when King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. lay at the Å¿iege of <hi>Callice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, Å¿uch as it was, and Å¿o qualified as you perceive, it was nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e complained of in Parliament, by a Petition from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as may appeare be the Records of the Å¿ame Parliament <hi>of</hi> 21. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. To which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or complaint, this anÅ¿were was given, <hi>That all the Å¿aid ImpoÅ¿itions were already taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Å¿ave only the Two Shillings upon a Å¿ack of Wooll, which Å¿hould laÅ¿t no longer then EaÅ¿ter, and Å¿eeing the Å¿ame was ordained for the Å¿afeguard of merchants, in which there had been greater Å¿ums of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:157030:39"/> money expended by the King, then could be collected between that and Michaelmas, therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Å¿ame till EaÅ¿ter, he hoped it would not Å¿eem over-burdenÅ¿ome or grieveous unto them.</hi> In the Parliament following, <hi>viz. anno</hi> 22. the Commons pray that writs may bee directed to the CuÅ¿tomers to forbeare at EaÅ¿ter next to take the two Å¿hillings upon a Å¿ack,<note place="margin">22 E. 3. N 16. Ro. Par.</note> according as it was granted at the laÅ¿t Parliament, and that it be not any longer continued by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Merchant. The King anÅ¿wereth, <hi>Let it ceaÅ¿e at EaÅ¿ter, as it was agreed the laÅ¿t Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you Å¿ee it was abÅ¿olutely taken away, and therefore though it had wanted theÅ¿e qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and circumÅ¿tances which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved it had, yet it being a thing Å¿o publiquely condemned, it ought to be of little force with you to juÅ¿tifie theÅ¿e preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions. But that which I obÅ¿erve out of this laÅ¿t Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, maketh me rather to incline that this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition was onely by way of diÅ¿penÅ¿ation, then that it was an abÅ¿olute ImpoÅ¿ition, Å¿uch as Ours are. For to what end (I pray you) Å¿hould the Commons pray that it might not be any longer continued by the procurement of any Merchant, except it were likely that Merchants for their benefit Å¿hould pray the longer continuance thereof; and what benefit can any impoÅ¿ition whatÅ¿oever bee to a Merchant except it bee by way of DiÅ¿penÅ¿ation
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:157030:40"/> to give him leave to trade where before Å¿uch diÅ¿penÅ¿ation given, he Å¿tood altogether reÅ¿trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If then it be an ImpoÅ¿ition by way of diÅ¿penÅ¿ation with a penall Statute of reÅ¿traint, then is it no preÅ¿ident for our preÅ¿ent impoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But whether or no it be a DiÅ¿penÅ¿ation or abÅ¿olute ImpoÅ¿ition I leave it to your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; you have heard my obÅ¿ervation.</p>
            <p>And Å¿o I come to the next preÅ¿ident in the times of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. produced for maintenance of our ImpoÅ¿itions,<note place="margin">24 E. 3. N. 12. Orig. de Scac.</note> which was in the 24 yeere of his Reigne, the Record of which and that which followed thereupon, I will without any inforcement at all, open unto you, and Å¿o leave it to your cenÅ¿ures. The King reciting, that whereas the Spanyard and French had joyned in league to make Warre againÅ¿t him, and that for the withÅ¿tanding of his Å¿aid adverÅ¿aries, as alÅ¿o for the Å¿afeguard of Merchants againÅ¿t Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, he had ordained that certaine Å¿hips Å¿hould be Å¿et forth; and that for maintenance of the Å¿aid Ships, there Å¿hould be paid by Merchants two Å¿hillings for every Å¿ack of Wooll, two Å¿hillings for three hundred Woolfels, foure Å¿hillings for a laÅ¿t of Lether, a Scute of Gold, or foure Å¿hil.<note place="margin">Poundage im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed.</note> for a tunne of Wine, and Å¿ix pence of the pound upon all other Merchandizes for one yeere following. He commandeth his CuÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to levy the Å¿ame accordingly.</p>
            <p>The very next yeere and Parliament follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">25 Ed 3. No. 12 Rot Par.</note> the Commons exhibite a Petition in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:157030:40"/> againÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿itions and other like charges, without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament: To which anÅ¿wer is given that, <hi>it is</hi> not <hi>the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they Å¿hould be charged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now gone through all the materiall Records here amongÅ¿t us, of the times of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in which, though his reign were very long, and by reaÅ¿on of his Warres, and other exceÅ¿Å¿ive charge, more occaÅ¿ion was given him to try the Å¿trength of this point of the Prerogative, then ever any King before or Å¿ince; though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and by many politicke inventions (as you have heard) he attempted to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h this Prerogative, of laying impoÅ¿itions without aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent in Parliament; yet can there not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in all his time, any more then two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idents of ImpoÅ¿itions like to theÅ¿e of ours; (that is) <hi>impoÅ¿ed by the Kings abÅ¿olute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> and yet theÅ¿e two were alÅ¿o, as you perceive, qualified with Å¿uch circumÅ¿tances, as if ours were Å¿uch, we Å¿hould have held them tolerable though perhaps not lawfull, yet they, Å¿uch as they were, eÅ¿caped not without being complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, and condemned alÅ¿o in Parliament, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be that Å¿ome one or two of theÅ¿e ImpoÅ¿itions which were by aÅ¿Å¿ent or grant of Merchants, in this time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. were in times when the paÅ¿Å¿age was open, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trained by act of Parliament, and Å¿o to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to our impoÅ¿itions: but whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:157030:41"/> by looking over the Statutes and Records with never Å¿o much heed conÅ¿ider the times of opening and Å¿hutting of the Sea by Statutes, Å¿hall finde it Å¿o intricate, as hee Å¿hall bee very hardly able directly to Å¿ay, that at the time when any of theÅ¿e impoÅ¿itions were granted, the paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age was open.</p>
            <p>If in my obÅ¿ervation I had found any Å¿uch, I Å¿hould have admitted it for an abÅ¿olute impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition, as I have done <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> which was by grant of Merchants; For certainly (as I have yeelded) the grant of Merchants is in this caÅ¿e of no other effect, then the declaration on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their aÅ¿Å¿ent; and the ImpoÅ¿ition reÅ¿teth meerly upon the kings authority: But I finde none Å¿uch, if any Å¿uch could be produced, you have heard how they have beene from time to time controlled in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And Å¿o I paÅ¿Å¿e from <hi>E.</hi> 3. to the times follow. From the end of the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 3. till the reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who was the eleventh Prince of this Realme, after <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. (as <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was the eleventh after the ConqueÅ¿t) being the Å¿pace of 170. yeers or thereabouts. It hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed by all thoÅ¿e that have argued in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his MajeÅ¿ties Right to ImpoÅ¿e, that there hath not been found one Record that proves any one impoÅ¿ition to have been laid; there are indeed in our printed bookes Å¿ome three or foure Statutes during that time, in which mention is made of ImpoÅ¿itions, but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:157030:41"/> they are (as I Å¿hall prove) ImpoÅ¿itions of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature then thoÅ¿e are which we complaine of; and Å¿o make nothing at all to the proofe of his MajeÅ¿ties Right: or if they were Å¿uch as ours are, yet are they no where found mentioned but with diÅ¿grace, and to the end to be taken away, which may be the reaÅ¿on, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding the great uÅ¿e that might have been made of three or foure PreÅ¿idents of ImpoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in theÅ¿e times, for the patching up of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the practiÅ¿e, which otherwiÅ¿e by this long diÅ¿continuance receives a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿h: thoÅ¿e which argued for impoÅ¿itions did not take hold of theÅ¿e, but choÅ¿e rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e that no ImpoÅ¿itions at all were laid during all this time, and labored to Å¿eek out the reaÅ¿ons of the diÅ¿continuance.</p>
            <p>I will briefely Å¿hew you what Statutes they are, during that time which, mention impoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the firÅ¿t is, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">11 R. 2. cap. 9. Statutes in which there is mention made of ImpoÅ¿itions after the end of Edw. the thirds raigne untill Queen Maries <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> No ImpoÅ¿ition nor charge Å¿hall be put upon Wools, Lether, or Woolfels, other than the CuÅ¿tome and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idie granted to the King this preÅ¿ent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if any be, the Å¿ame Å¿hall be repealed and annulled, as it was another time ordained by Statute, Å¿aving alway to the King his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent right. If by this Å¿aving the pretended right of impoÅ¿ing Å¿hould be excepted (as was Å¿aid in the Exchequer) the Å¿aving Å¿hould then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the body of the Act, and therefore it muÅ¿t needs have Å¿ome other interpretation, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:157030:42"/> it may Å¿tand with the reÅ¿t of the Act, and not condemn the Law makers of Å¿o much want of diÅ¿cretion: therefore doubtleÅ¿Å¿e this (Å¿aving) is no other then an exception of the ancient Right, full CuÅ¿tomes, due upon thoÅ¿e Å¿taple Commodities. And for my part I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Statute was made, not Å¿o much to take away any ImpoÅ¿ition laid by this King <hi>R.</hi> 2. as out of a provident and prudent care in the Law makers, proceeding from the freÅ¿h memory of the practiÅ¿e of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in this kinde; For all thoÅ¿e that were of this Parliament, did live and were at mans age in <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. time, and could not but well remember the grievouÅ¿nes of his ImpoÅ¿itions: BeÅ¿ides, I obÅ¿erve that they deÅ¿ire, that no ImpoÅ¿ition be laid by way of addition to the SubÅ¿idie, upon Wools and Lether then granted: It was never heard till of late, that an ImpoÅ¿ition upon any Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, was charged at the Å¿ame time with a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idie, and therefore without queÅ¿tion, this was no other then an aboundant proviÅ¿ion by them wherein they were no more carefull then any wiÅ¿e man would be in the like caÅ¿e; when they had of their own free wils given the King a liberall gift, they were carefull not to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged by him.</p>
            <p>The next Statute in theÅ¿e times, where Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions are found mentioned is, 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">23 H. 6. cap. 18.</note> By which it appeares that EngliÅ¿h Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants being reÅ¿trained from repayring to <hi>G<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Though Å¿ome that have argued before me againÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿itions have urged this Statute, as making againÅ¿t our preÅ¿ent ImpoÅ¿itions, yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:157030:43"/> for my part, I am not of that opinion, but upon peruÅ¿ing the Statute, doe rather thinke, that it extendeth only to impoÅ¿itions laid by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>London,</hi> upon the Merchants of other Cities and Townes not incorporate into their Companies, as will evidently appeare by the Statute: Å¿o as notwithÅ¿tanding this Statute, that which I have averred, and hath been yeelded to by the Kings CounÅ¿ell, that no ImpoÅ¿ition was laid from <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to Queene <hi>Maries</hi> reigne, is not yet impeached.</p>

            <p>From the 5. to the 18. yeere of his Reigne, he obtained every other yeer one aide or other in Parliament; Å¿ometimes a taxe, Å¿ometimes a Fifteenth, Å¿ometimes a SubÅ¿idie of Tonnage &amp; Poundage: In the eighteenth yeer, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to go in perÅ¿on into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Å¿ettle the Å¿tate of that Country then in Rebelion: all theÅ¿e troubles he had from abroade beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Rebellions here at home, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards caÅ¿t him out of his Seat; yet did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for all this attempt to lay impoÅ¿itions, though he wanted not about him, to put him in minde of his abÅ¿olute power: For <hi>Edward Strafford,</hi> BiÅ¿hop of Exeter, Lord Chancellor of England, in a Sermon made to the Parliament held, <hi>anno</hi> 21. as our Chronicles report, did publiquely maintaint that the King was not bound by any Law; but was of himÅ¿elf abÅ¿olute &amp; above Law, and that to controle any of his actions was an offence worthy of Death, at which Parliament all that were preÅ¿ent came

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:157030:48"/> the Kings right (eÅ¿pecially in Å¿o high a point of profit) had but had the leaÅ¿t notice of Å¿o profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a Prerogative as this, would they not have been at Å¿trife which of them Å¿hould firÅ¿t have put the king in minde thereof? Or if they had held it queÅ¿tionable, would they not have put it to Å¿ome triall? Certainly there can be no cauÅ¿e imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Å¿hould make them thus to forbeare, but either they were utterly ignorant of any Å¿uch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, or, that knowing Å¿uch a thing to be clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Å¿ome of the ancient kings (eÅ¿pecially by <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.) they knew likewiÅ¿e that it was in the Å¿ame times continually complained of in Parliament, and alwayes condemned; and that there were acts of Parliament directly againÅ¿t it, and this is more probably to bee conceived of them being men of Å¿uch Å¿earching Å¿pirits, and Å¿o well Å¿tudied in point of Prerogative, then that they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the practiÅ¿e of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. conÅ¿idering alÅ¿o that they were nerer to thoÅ¿e times by 120 yeers then wee are.</p>
            <p>But that which moÅ¿t of all moves me herein is that there was in <hi>H.</hi> 7. time Å¿uch an occaÅ¿ion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered of making uÅ¿e of this Prerogative, as there could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly happen any other that might better have juÅ¿tified the laying of ImpoÅ¿itions; which was this: The Venetians, to the intent to drive our Merchants from fetching Å¿weet wines at <hi>Candy,</hi> that they might the better imploy their owne Å¿hips and Merchants, did impoÅ¿e upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very But of MalmeÅ¿ey brought thence by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliÅ¿h
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:157030:49"/> Merchants foure Duccats, by which means the EngliÅ¿h wholly loÅ¿t that Trade, and the Venetians made the whole profit thereof: This miÅ¿chiefe was no other way better to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, than by impoÅ¿ing the like, or a greater charge upon Merchants of <hi>Candy</hi> bringing Malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ey into England; that Å¿o they of <hi>Candy</hi> not being able to afford them better cheape than the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h, the EngliÅ¿h might Å¿till fetch them from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> as they had wont to doe. I Å¿ay, there could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly be a more juÅ¿tifiable occaÅ¿ion of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ImpoÅ¿itions, than this was: And did this king (Å¿o carefull in other things of preÅ¿erving his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and moÅ¿t of all in matters that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his profit) take hold of this occaÅ¿ion to lay an ImpoÅ¿ition by his abÅ¿olute power? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though he Å¿aw it convenient, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neceÅ¿Å¿ary, yet he conceived it to be unlawfull Å¿o to doe; and therefore did it not by his abÅ¿olute power, but by aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the Statute of 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. printed; where, in the preamble of the Act, you Å¿hall Å¿ee the occaÅ¿ion of the making of the Act to be as I have opened it unto you: and you may perceive by the body of the Act, that for the counterpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of the impoÅ¿ition of foure Duccats laid by the Venetians upon our Merchants, there was impoÅ¿ed 18<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. for a But of MalmeÅ¿ey, upon their Merchants bringing it hither, to laÅ¿t as long as the impoÅ¿ition of foure Duccats (which, as appeares by the Act, came but to 18<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.of our mony) Å¿hould
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:157030:49"/> endure. It is not probable that this king, conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his other actions, would have Å¿uffered this to have been done by Parliament, if he had thought he might have lawfully done it by his abÅ¿olute power? And therfore it cannot almoÅ¿t be gaine-Å¿aid, that in theÅ¿e times this pretended Prerogative of laying ImpoÅ¿itions without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament was held to be againÅ¿t Law.</p>

Finding that this way would not Å¿erve his turne, hee demanded a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which not anÅ¿wering his expectation, hee did the Å¿ame yeere raiÅ¿e unto himÅ¿elfe a great deale of treaÅ¿ure by abaÅ¿ing his gold.</p>
            <p>Such things as theÅ¿e Princes never put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e but when all other meanes faile them, and yet hee went many degrees beyond this: For, in the 27. yeer of his reigne he Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed above 370 Religious houÅ¿es, the yeerly value of whoÅ¿e revenues I have read to be no leÅ¿Å¿e than 32000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>per annum</hi> in thoÅ¿e dayes: and that of their goods (Å¿old at very low priÅ¿es) he made above 100000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. in preÅ¿ent money. About 4. yeares after he diÅ¿Å¿olved all the MonaÅ¿teries, Abbeies, Priories, Nunneries, and all other Religious hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of what kinde Å¿oever throughout England. By which meanes, and by the Å¿ale of their goods he gathered Å¿uch a maÅ¿Å¿e of TreaÅ¿ure, as it might have been imagined that never any king of this Realme Å¿hould have needed to have Å¿ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe at his Subjects hands: Yet he himÅ¿elfe, no longer than within 3. yeeres after following, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and obteined (as may appeare by the Statutes of that time) an exceÅ¿Å¿ive great Ayde by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:157030:50"/> and yet the yeere following hee did alÅ¿o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baÅ¿e his coyne, more then halfe in halfe, Å¿uch an abaÅ¿ement as never before or Å¿ince was heard of, and could not but bee very grievous to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but becauÅ¿e perhaps they held it lawfull Å¿o to doe, they made no pubilque complaint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and it is worth the obÅ¿erving, That though this Prerogative of abaÅ¿ing Coyne be a thing which trencheth as deepely into the privat inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t of the Subject as the laying of ImpoÅ¿itions; for, by this meanes a man, that this day is worth in revenues a hundred pounds <hi>per an.</hi> hee Å¿hall to morrow, if the king be Å¿o pleaÅ¿ed, be worth but fifty or forty, or leÅ¿Å¿e, in reall value; and though alÅ¿o the practiÅ¿e of this Prerogative hath not been forborne by any of the kings of this Realm, and that Å¿ome of them have uÅ¿ed it very immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, yet cannot there be found any one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique complaint, that ever I have met withall, upon Record againÅ¿t it, as from time to time there have beene many againÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿itions, which argues that the Subject did make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theÅ¿e two Prerogatives; this, of laying ImpoÅ¿itions; and that, of abaÅ¿ing coyne; thinking the one lawfull and the other not. But to conclude my obÅ¿ervations upon the actions of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. The next yeere after this unconÅ¿ciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abaÅ¿ement of his money, hee craved a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. The yeere following he tooke the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of all the Chantries, Colledges and free Chappels, &amp;c. during his life, which ended the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:157030:51"/> next yeere: Can any man imagine that during this kings Reigne it was held lawfull (or any Å¿uch thing Å¿o much as dreamed of) to rayÅ¿e trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure by laying ImpoÅ¿itions; I will enforce it no farther, but leave it to the judgement of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable man that Å¿hall conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e things which I have remembred, whether or no it bee likely.</p>

Neither the neceÅ¿sity of juÅ¿t and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable warre, nor the Å¿ubtleties and curioÅ¿itie of Peace, nor the prodigality of Å¿ome of theÅ¿e Kings for the better Å¿atisfying of their pleaÅ¿ures, nor the covetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of others, nor the Å¿oftneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿ome of their diÅ¿poÅ¿itions,

            </p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿ition that Å¿he layd,<note place="margin">Qu. Mary.</note> was that upon Cloth, continued till this day, which grew upon a Å¿peciall reaÅ¿on, as may appeare by the printed booke of the rates of her CuÅ¿tomes and SubÅ¿idies; in the end whereof you Å¿hall finde a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration expreÅ¿Å¿ing the loÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿teined by reaÅ¿on of the difference between the CuÅ¿tomes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idies of Wool and cloth, by which it appeares that a Å¿ack of Wool yeelded in cuÅ¿tome Å¿ix Å¿hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence, and in SubÅ¿idie thirty three Å¿hillings foure pence; that the cuÅ¿tom upon a Å¿hort cloth was fourteene-pence, and that a Å¿ack of Wool did commonly make foure Å¿hort clothes, the cuÅ¿tome of which was foure Å¿hillings eight pence; Å¿o that the custome of Wool made into cloth, was leÅ¿Å¿e then the CuÅ¿tome and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idie of Å¿o much Wool not cloathed; In every Å¿ack in Å¿hort clothes thirty five Å¿hillings foure-pence: which difference was reduced to an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by rating upon every Å¿hort cloth ten Å¿hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: After this declaration made of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and of the rate which reduced both to an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:157030:52"/> equality, follow theÅ¿e words; Which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conÅ¿idered, and the great loÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿teined by Us in the Å¿ame, by reaÅ¿on that cloathing is much increaÅ¿ed, It is thought convenient by Us, with the advice of our Councell, towards the reliefe of the loÅ¿Å¿e, for to aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e upon the Clothes carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, by way of Merchandize, Å¿ome larger rate then heretofore hath been uÅ¿ed, and though it were reaÅ¿on to appoint Å¿uch a rate as might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the full of the loÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿teined, yet upon divers conÅ¿iderations, at this time, Us and Our Councell moving, Wee are pleaÅ¿ed only to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e upon every Å¿hort-cloath, by the name of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome, Å¿ix Å¿hillings eight pence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I thought good to open this at large unto you that you might Å¿ee upon what Å¿peciall reaÅ¿on of equity this ImpoÅ¿ition was grounded, and how it differeth from ours: And it is worthy the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erving, how the Queene commandeth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome to be yeelded unto her, not as an ImpoÅ¿ition, or by the name of ImpoÅ¿t, but by the name of CuÅ¿tome, becauÅ¿e it cometh in lieu of the ancient CuÅ¿tome upon Wooll, which is the reaÅ¿on that at this day it is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and paid by that name; whereas no other new raiÅ¿ed duty hath that priviledge; but they are either called SubÅ¿idie of Tonnage or Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, if they be raiÅ¿ed by act of Parliament; or ImpoÅ¿t, if by the Kings abÅ¿olute power.</p>
            <p>The name of CuÅ¿tome was anciently given to none but to Wools, Wool-fells, and Leather;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:157030:52"/> and upon this occaÅ¿ion, to Cloth alÅ¿o.</p>
            <p>This ImpoÅ¿ition, though grounded upon Å¿uch equity as you have heard, yet in <hi>Dyer,</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz. fo.</hi> 165. <hi>a.</hi> &amp; <hi>b.</hi> it was, as appeares by my L. <hi>Dyer,</hi> complayned of by the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> with great exclamation (which are his words) and Å¿uit to the Queen to be unburdoned of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it was not granted in Parliament, but aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of her abÅ¿olute power: whereupon there were divers aÅ¿Å¿emblies and conferences of the JuÅ¿tices and others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plowdens</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againÅ¿t it, in M. <hi>Tates</hi> hand.</note> but their reÅ¿olution is no where to be found, at leaÅ¿t by Us; It is very probable that if they had given judgement for the Queen, it would not have beene kept cloÅ¿e, but howÅ¿oever the profit was too great to be taken from the Crowne and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it continues till this day.</p>
            <p>HowÅ¿oever the reaÅ¿on in equity in the laying this ImpoÅ¿ition upon Cloth may Å¿eeme to bee Å¿ound unto Å¿ome men, and Å¿o to allow of this ImpoÅ¿ition as differing from ours, yet for my part, I hold it not Å¿o, when I conÅ¿ider what courÅ¿e was taken by <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. upon the Å¿ame occaÅ¿ion, <hi>an.</hi> 11. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. It was enacted, that no wooll Å¿hould be caried out of <hi>England,</hi> but by the Kings licence; and that no man Å¿hould weare Cloth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Å¿uch as Å¿hould be made in <hi>England:</hi> this Law tooke Å¿uch effect, as within ten yeeres the greateÅ¿t part of the Wooll in <hi>England</hi> was made into Cloth; and it became to be tranÅ¿ported in Å¿uch abundance, by reaÅ¿on that there was no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:157030:53"/> at all due upon Cloth, and the CuÅ¿tome and SubÅ¿idie upon Wools was very high, that in the 21 yeere, the King finding his CuÅ¿tome of Wools Å¿o much decreaÅ¿ed, doth Å¿eeke to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it, not by impoÅ¿ing a new charge upon Cloth by his abÅ¿olute power, as Qu. <hi>Mary</hi> did, but did it by aÅ¿Å¿ent of his Subjects in full Parliament, as I collect partly by my L. <hi>Dyer</hi> in the place laÅ¿t mentioned, but more fully by a recitall in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongÅ¿t us, of 24. <hi>E</hi> 3. <hi>ro.</hi> 13. <hi>orig de Scaccar.</hi> to this effect: <hi>That whereas the CuÅ¿tomes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idies due and granted upon Wools are much decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, becauÅ¿e a great part of the Wooll of England is made into Cloth, for which no CuÅ¿tome is due; and whereas in conÅ¿ideration thereof, at our Councel held the 21 yeere of our Reigne, by the common aÅ¿Å¿ent of the Prelates, Earles and Barons, and others, it was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accorded, that</hi> 14<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>by Denizens, and</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>by Strangers Å¿hould be paid for every cloth of AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿e, &amp;c. made of EngliÅ¿h wooll, and tranÅ¿ported; upon paine of forfeiture of the Clothes:</hi> And Å¿o followeth an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given to collect the Å¿ame.</p>
            <p>The next ImpoÅ¿ition laid by Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> was forty Å¿hillings upon a Tun of French wines, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed in the 5 yeere of her Reigne: at which time there was firÅ¿t a Proclamation made, that no wines at all Å¿hould be brought from France, being then in enmity with England, upon paine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Wines; (which, by the way, is a Å¿trange clauÅ¿e in a proclamation.) Immediately after this reÅ¿traint there was an order made by the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:157030:53"/> 
               <hi>Qu.</hi> and her privy CounÅ¿ell, that Å¿uch as would might bring in French wines, notwithÅ¿tanding the Proclamation, paying forty Å¿hillings upon every Tun by the name of ImpoÅ¿t, as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by Record in the Rolls of EaÅ¿ter Terme, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the office of the <hi>K.</hi> Remembrancer of the Exchequer, in the caÅ¿e of one <hi>Germane Ciol,</hi>
               <note place="margin">German Ciols <hi>caÅ¿e.</hi>
               </note> againÅ¿t whom an Information was exhibited for not paying the Å¿aid ImpoÅ¿ition: Whereunto, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it by way of TraverÅ¿e, that there is any Law of the Land by which he may be charged with ImpoÅ¿t, he pleads a licence made unto him, <hi>an.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Ph. &amp; Mar.</hi> to import a certaine number of Tunnes of Wine within a certain time, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traint then made, or afterwards to be made to the contrary, notwithÅ¿tanding; Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that the CuÅ¿tome, SubÅ¿idie, and other duties due and accuÅ¿tomed to be paid to the King and Queen, were duly Å¿atisfied; He Å¿hewes, that for all Wines brought in by him during the life of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he paid the SubÅ¿idie of Tonnage, <hi>viz.</hi> three Å¿hillings for every Tun, which was all that was due and accuÅ¿tomed to be paid: Upon this plea a demurrer was joyned, and judgement given thereupon againÅ¿t the Queen; This Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been enforced in the maintenance of ImpoÅ¿itions: Whether or no it make not rather againÅ¿t them, I leave to your cenÅ¿ures.</p>
            <p>Neere about the Å¿ame time there were Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions laid alÅ¿o by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> upon all French commodities whatÅ¿oever to be imported, as may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:157030:54"/> appeare by the Port-bookes of thoÅ¿e times in the Exchequer; which ImpoÅ¿itions were received to the uÅ¿e of Queene <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the beginning of the 1 yeere of her Reign, but ere the yeer ended they were all taken away, as may appeare by the Å¿ame Port-bookes; which in my opinion is a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that they were not then held lawfull: For, Princes doe not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily give over their hold in matters of profit, if they be any way able to maintain it. What hath hitherto upheld the ImpoÅ¿ition upon Wines, I know not, except it be the great profit that comes by it to the Crown, and becauÅ¿e there was never any late Judgement given directly againÅ¿t ImpoÅ¿itions.</p>
            <p>You have hitherto heard what reaÅ¿on and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect proofe I have uÅ¿ed,<note place="margin">Admitting the king had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

But now, admitting that by the Common-Law it had been cleere and without queÅ¿tion, that the King might at his will have laid ImpoÅ¿itions and that alÅ¿o the Å¿ame could have been cleerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the practiÅ¿e of the ancient Kings, yet I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Å¿o Å¿tands the Law of England at this day (by reaÅ¿on of Statutes directly in the point) as the Kings power, if ever he had any to impoÅ¿e, is not onely limited, but utterly taken away, as I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:157030:54"/> hope I Å¿hall be able evidently to prove, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding any objection that hath been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the interpretation of the Statutes to this Å¿enÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t Statute is in <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 30.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Magna Charta cap.</hi> 30. Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jections made againÅ¿t it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered.</note> The words are; <hi>All Merchants, if they were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly prohibited before, Å¿hall have their Å¿afe and Å¿ure conducts, to enter and depart, to goe and tarrie in the Realme as well by Land as by water, to buy and Å¿ell without any evill tolls, by the old and rightfull Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tomes (except in the time of Warre.) And if they be of the Land making warre againÅ¿t us, and be found in our Realme at the beginning of the warre, they Å¿hall be attached without harme of body, or goods, untill it be knowne to us, or our JuÅ¿tices, how our Merchants be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated there in the Land making war againÅ¿t us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Statute of which this is a branch, is the moÅ¿t ancient Statute-Law we have, wonne and Å¿ealed with the blood of our AnceÅ¿tors; Å¿o reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ced in former times, that it hath been by Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament provided, that TranÅ¿cripts thereof Å¿hould be Å¿ent to all the Cathedrall Churches of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, there to remaine; that it Å¿hould be twice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yeere publikely read before the people; that likewiÅ¿e twice every yeere there Å¿hould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication Å¿olemnly denounced to the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers thereof; that all Statutes and all Judgements given againÅ¿t it Å¿hal be held as void; that it Å¿hould be received and allowed as the Common-Law, by all Å¿uch as have the adminiÅ¿tration of JuÅ¿tice;<note place="margin">25 <hi>E.</hi> 1 <hi>cap.</hi> 1.2.3.4.</note> and it hath been no leÅ¿Å¿e than 29 times Å¿olemnly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:157030:55"/> confirmed in Parliament: I will therefore with Å¿o much the more care endeavor to free this Law from all the objections that have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t it.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t objection doth tend to the diminiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the extent of this Statute,<note place="margin">The firÅ¿t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that it extendeth only to Merchant-Å¿trangers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered.</note> as touching the perÅ¿ons whom it may concerne; for it hath been collected out of the latter words of the Statute, that it Å¿hould extend onely to Merchants-Aliens, and not to Denizens.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, it is improbable that the makers of the Law Å¿hould be more carefull to provide for the indempnity of Merchant-Å¿trangers than of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h; except perhaps they might imagine that EngliÅ¿h Merchants were already Å¿ufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the Common-Law: If that were their reaÅ¿on (as there could be no other that I can imagine) it doth as much maintaine my opinion, as if they had been conteined within the Statute.</p>
            <p>Again, the words are generall: All Merchants; and,<hi>Qui omnes dixerit, nullos excipit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, the Statute is a beneficiall Law; in which caÅ¿e particular and Å¿peciall words doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes admit a generall extent: And therefore, to reÅ¿traine generall words, as the Objectors would, is againÅ¿t all reaÅ¿on, and rule of Law. As for the latter words, 'tis true, they doe indeed extend onely to Merchant-Å¿trangers; but the Å¿enÅ¿e of the firÅ¿t Å¿entence is perfect without this: and as long as no abÅ¿urdity nor contradiction doth follow by interpreting the firÅ¿t words to extend to all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:157030:55"/> Merchants in generall, and the latter onely to Merchant-Å¿trangers, the moÅ¿t ample and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conÅ¿truction is ever the beÅ¿t, as in all other Statutes of this nature.</p>
            <p>But this objection is, in my opinion, cleerly removed by 2. Statutes made by <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this very clauÅ¿e: The firÅ¿t is, 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. the words are, <hi>All merchants, Strangers and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies may goe and come with their merchandizes into England, after the tenure of the Great Charter.</hi> I take it, that <hi>Privies</hi> in this place, being the very word that is found in the Originall, which is in French, ought to be underÅ¿tood Denizens; for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e I Å¿uppoÅ¿e it would have been joyned to the word [Strangers] by a conjunction disjunctive, which is uÅ¿uall where the words are of one Å¿enÅ¿e; and not by a copulative, as here it is. BeÅ¿ides, I take the word [Privy] to be derived from the Latine, <hi>Privatus,</hi> which Å¿ignifieth a particular property; as <hi>res privata,</hi> a mans owne private e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate: Å¿o, <hi>mercatores privati,</hi> our own Merchants. That Merchant-Å¿trangers Å¿hould be firÅ¿t named, is common in Statutes and Records.</p>
            <p>The next Statute explaining this of <hi>magna Charta,</hi> is, 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.

            <p>The Å¿econd Objection made againÅ¿t this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:157030:56"/> branch of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Å¿econd Objection. That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> cap 30. was made only againÅ¿t Taxes within the Land, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered.</note> is, That the meaning thereof was to Å¿ecure the Merchants, not from a new increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome to be impoÅ¿ed by the King, to be paid at their entrance or going out of the Ports, Å¿uch as our ImpoÅ¿itions are; but from certaine petty exactions, as Tolls and Å¿uch like, which were then uÅ¿ually demanded of them within the Land, by the Townes through which they were to paÅ¿Å¿e and where they Å¿old their Merchandize; for the farther remedy of which there were afterwards divers Statutes made which doe evidently manifeÅ¿t that Å¿uch was the miÅ¿chiefe, and they doe the rather make this collection becauÅ¿e of the words, <hi>buy and Å¿ell without evill tolts;</hi> For, Å¿ay they, ImpoÅ¿itions are not paid upon the buying and Å¿elling of Merchandize, but when they are to Å¿hip or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip: they take hold of the word Toll, which properly is an exaction for paÅ¿Å¿age within the land, or for Å¿ale in markets or faires. TheÅ¿e ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, notwithÅ¿tanding I hold it Å¿omewhat cleere that the meaning of this Statute was principally to Å¿ecure Merchants touching Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions. My firÅ¿t argument is drawn <hi>ab Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate,</hi> from the authority of the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t and moÅ¿t Å¿age men in greateÅ¿t places and offices within this kingdom, in the times wherein they lived, and who alÅ¿o could Å¿o much the better judge of the true meaneng of this Statute in that they lived Å¿o neere the time of the making thereof, even in the beginning of the reigne of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:157030:56"/> the next King (Å¿ave one) to him that made this Statute: I meane thoÅ¿e who made the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. heretofore divers times men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by me, who in alledging their reaÅ¿on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> doe amongÅ¿t other things Å¿ay that the Å¿ame was made againÅ¿t <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta;</hi> What was the cauÅ¿e of the griefe conceived againÅ¿t <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> other then the ImpoÅ¿itions by colour thereof, laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forraine commodities; It appeares by the Ordinance, that was the onely cauÅ¿e: if then <hi>Charta Mercatoria</hi> were by them adjudged to be againÅ¿t <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> only becauÅ¿e by colour thereof, new ImpoÅ¿itions were raiÅ¿ed, without aÅ¿Å¿ent of Parliament, it is evident, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be made againÅ¿t impoÅ¿itions; if they had thought it to have extended onely to petty tolls and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions within the land, as is objected, then could it not have extended to <hi>Charta Mercatoria.</hi> As for the words <hi>Buy</hi> and <hi>Sell,</hi> without any manner of evill Toll; I denie not but the words may perhaps have that Å¿enÅ¿e, which hath been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that in buying and Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they Å¿hould be free alÅ¿o from unjuÅ¿t exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the land. But I Å¿ay further, that theÅ¿e words, without any manner of Evill Toll, by the old and rightfull CuÅ¿tomes, do extend not onely to the next precedent words (Buy and Å¿ell) but alÅ¿o to the former words, Enter and returne, and more principally to them then to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:157030:57"/> any other; For to have provided that they Å¿hould be free from thoÅ¿e petty exactions of tolls in Markets, and for paÅ¿Å¿ing through Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes, and to leave them Å¿ubject to ImpoÅ¿itions, to be laid on at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, had been but a Å¿lender Å¿ecuritie. This expoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine is confirmed by a Record here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t us, of 16. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. no longer then Å¿even yeers after the making of this Statute. By which it appeares, that the King commanded his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, at the <hi>Ports, to Å¿ignifie to all Merchants, that they might with Å¿afetie enter into his kingdom, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rightfull and ancient cuÅ¿tomes, Nec time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Å¿ibi de Maletoltis quas faciet Rex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the word Toll,<note place="margin">Derivation of the word <hi>Toll.</hi>
               </note> which they Å¿ay is to be underÅ¿tood of Toles for paÅ¿Å¿ages, and for buying and Å¿elling in Faires and Markets, it behoves me to Å¿ay Å¿omething of the derivation thereof, the rather becauÅ¿e it is very often uÅ¿ed in our ancient Statutes and Records in the Å¿ame Å¿enÅ¿e, as it is in this place; and by the derivation thereof the naturall and true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word Å¿hall be beÅ¿t underÅ¿tood; I hold it therefore to be derived from the Latine word <hi>Teolonium,</hi> which Å¿ignifies cuÅ¿tome, by cutting off the latter part of the word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining onely the firÅ¿t part <hi>Teol,</hi> by contraction <hi>Toll,</hi> of which manner of derivation, there are infinite examples in our language, the Latine <hi>Teolonium</hi> (as Å¿aith <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Lexicon Juris Civilis)</hi> is derived from the Greek <hi>Telos,</hi> which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:157030:57"/> Å¿ignifies aÅ¿well CuÅ¿tom as it doth <hi>Finis:</hi> Hence it is that the CuÅ¿tomers are called in Latine <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonarii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you Å¿ee that the genuine, and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Å¿ignification of our word <hi>Toll,</hi> is no other then CuÅ¿tome upon Merchandizes: from the word <hi>Toll</hi> are come thoÅ¿e two barbarours Latine words found in our Statutes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, <hi>Toltum,</hi> which is the word uÅ¿ed in the Record of 16 <hi>H.</hi> 6. but even now vouched by me; and <hi>Tolnetum,</hi> the Originall word in the Statute now in queÅ¿tion, which I muÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e is alÅ¿o in our Law Latine uÅ¿ed by us for <hi>Toll</hi> in the Market, and <hi>Toll</hi> for paÅ¿Å¿age, as may appear by the RegiÅ¿ter, and the Book of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etries. But in this place, <hi>Malum tolnetum</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ignifies not a Toll in the common Å¿ence, but an unlawfull charge laid by the King upon Merchandizes, as an increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Å¿ignification, which is evidently proved in that it is here oppoÅ¿ed to old and rightfull CuÅ¿tomes; <hi>Å¿ine omnibus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Tolnetis per certas &amp; antiquas conÅ¿uetudines;</hi> wherfore it ought Å¿o to have been tranÅ¿lated, for Å¿o it Å¿ignifies, without ImpoÅ¿itions, by the old and rightfull CuÅ¿tome: This expoÅ¿ition and tranÅ¿lation is further warranted by the uÅ¿e of the word <hi>Maletolt,</hi> Å¿o often found in our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Statutes &amp; Records, which without Å¿cruple is derived from the Latine, <hi>Malum Tolnetum,</hi> the very word of our Statute; I finde it diverÅ¿ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:157030:58"/> written, <hi>Maletout, Maletolt, Maletot,</hi> and Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Maletent,</hi> but I never finde it any where uÅ¿ed in any other Å¿ence then for an ImpoÅ¿ition by way of increaÅ¿e of CuÅ¿tome upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes: Sometimes indeed but that very rarely, It is taken in the beÅ¿t Å¿ence for lawfull and rightfull CuÅ¿tome, as the word ImpoÅ¿ition Å¿ometimes is, but then commonly it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with another word to free it from the worÅ¿t Å¿ence, as <hi>Droiturel Maletout, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>malis Tolnetis</hi> is in this place ought to be tranÅ¿la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ImpoÅ¿itions, may be farther proved by that which I finde in a writer of the french HiÅ¿tory, one <hi>Jean Serres,</hi> who Å¿aies, That in the time of <hi>Philip le Beau</hi> king of France, which was about the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. king of England, there were rebellions in France becauÅ¿e of ImpoÅ¿itions laid by the K. which in thoÅ¿e days, they did, Å¿aith he, call <hi>Maletouts,</hi> the very word then anciently u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in Engl. for ImpoÅ¿itions, as may plentifully appeare by the Statutes and Records of <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; Ed.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">The word ImpoÅ¿ition.</note> for the word <hi>ImpoÅ¿ition</hi> was not uÅ¿ed in any French Record, Statute or other, for ought I have Å¿eene, till <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.

            <p>But becauÅ¿e there hath been Å¿ome exception alÅ¿o taken to the expoÅ¿ition of the word <hi>CuÅ¿tom</hi> in that Å¿ence in which I take it (that is) for cuÅ¿tome upon Merchandize, for that the word in the Originall is <hi>ConÅ¿uetudo,</hi>

I anÅ¿were, admit it were by the kings abÅ¿olute power, yet that the king hath cleerely diÅ¿charged himÅ¿elf of that power by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, I hope I have cleerely proved: But this queÅ¿tion, How began the firÅ¿t CuÅ¿toms? is beÅ¿t anÅ¿wered by another queÅ¿tion, How began the Fine for purchaÅ¿e of Originall VVrits? the Fine <hi>pro licentia concordandi?</hi> the certainty of priÅ¿age? nay, who reduced it firÅ¿t to certaintie

If the king may increaÅ¿e his Fines upon the purchaÅ¿e of Originall writts (which by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on hee may doe, that hee may doe his CuÅ¿tome, nay, hee hath more colour for this then for that, becauÅ¿e there is no Statute againÅ¿t this) hee might eaÅ¿ily raiÅ¿e that revenue to the value of his CuÅ¿tomes: But no man can, nor will I hope offer to mainteine it to bee lawfull.

In anÅ¿wer of which I will conÅ¿ider how farre the king may reÅ¿train the paÅ¿Å¿age of Merchants; and then will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:157030:70"/> examine the conÅ¿equence of the Argument.</p>
            <p>For my part, I think the king cannot reÅ¿train the paÅ¿Å¿age of Merchants, but for Å¿ome Å¿peciall cauÅ¿e; wherein to define certainly and reÅ¿olute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Å¿ay for what cauÅ¿es he may, and for what not, I will not undertake: Onely let me inform you, that there is not one of theÅ¿e preÅ¿idents vouched by them to prove the kings power to reÅ¿traine, but they are upon Å¿peciall reaÅ¿ons; as by reaÅ¿on of Enmity with Å¿uch a Nation from whence they are reÅ¿trained, or becauÅ¿e Å¿uch a Commodity may not be Å¿pared within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: BeÅ¿ides, they are not reÅ¿traints from all places, and of all manner of Merchandizes, but from certain places onely, and for certain Å¿orts of Merchandizes: And for my part I thinke that reÅ¿traints in all theÅ¿e caÅ¿es, and of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are by the Common-Law left to the kings abÅ¿olute power; For if it were otherwiÅ¿e, it Å¿hould be in the power of a Merchant, for a little private lucre, to enrich the kings Enemies, or to furniÅ¿h them with munition to be imployed againÅ¿t the State, or utterly to ruine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, by carrying out a Commodity which may not be Å¿pared, or by bringing in of Å¿ome that may be hurtfull. Nay (which is more) Å¿uch may be the occaÅ¿ion, that the king may, I doubt not, Å¿top the paÅ¿Å¿ages of all Merchants from all places for a Å¿hort time, as upon the death of the late Queene it was put in practiÅ¿e, to prevent Intelligence: there may likewiÅ¿e be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:157030:70"/> Å¿uch neceÅ¿Å¿ary uÅ¿e of their Å¿hips, as the want of them, upon Å¿ome Å¿odaine attempts, may be a cauÅ¿e of the overthrow of the whole State. In Å¿uch caÅ¿es as theÅ¿e, if the Common law did not give the King leave to reÅ¿traine their paÅ¿Å¿age by his abÅ¿olute power, it were very improvident in the higheÅ¿t points, which cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Å¿o wiÅ¿e a law; And yet the Kings of this Realme have alwayes been Å¿paring in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e of their abÅ¿olute power in this point, For there are little leÅ¿Å¿e then 30. Acts of Parliament, touching the opening and Å¿hutting up of the paÅ¿Å¿age of Merchants, moÅ¿t of which, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, were made rather for the increaÅ¿e of puniÅ¿hment, then for want of power in the King, For the breach of a reÅ¿traint by abÅ¿olute commandment, is puniÅ¿hable, as all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, onely by Fine and ImpriÅ¿onment, and not by forfeiture of the Merchandizes, as in the preÅ¿ident of the Wines, <hi>An.</hi> 5. of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> vouched by me, and is in Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idents. If it be otherwiÅ¿e, I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e I know not the reaÅ¿on of the difference of this from other contempts. You Å¿ee that I have yeelded to their propoÅ¿ition, <hi>That the King may by his abÅ¿olute power reÅ¿traine the paÅ¿Å¿age ef Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> and have therein granted, more then their preÅ¿idents prove; But is the conÅ¿equence good, that becauÅ¿e the King may reÅ¿train, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may impoÅ¿e upon Å¿uch as paÅ¿Å¿e? FirÅ¿t I denie that in our caÅ¿e there is any reÅ¿traint at
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:157030:71"/> all, as there was in the caÅ¿e of the French Wines, by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by her Proclamation going before the impoÅ¿ition. For proofe of which, I referre you to the Kings Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents prefixed before the laÅ¿t Book of Rates, by which inÅ¿trument, the impoÅ¿itions now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, were altogether raiÅ¿ed, you Å¿hall finde it no other then a Declaration of the Kings pleaÅ¿ure Å¿o to have it, and a courÅ¿e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed for levying of it; But admitting that the very laying of an impoÅ¿ition, did implie a reÅ¿traint, yet I denie the conÅ¿equence, BecauÅ¿e the King may reÅ¿traine totally, that therefore he may reÅ¿traine for a time, or from certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or certaine commodities, or certaine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. This indeed is a good Argument, <hi>a majori ad minus.</hi> But becauÅ¿e he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traine totally, therefore that he may give paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age for money, is no good conÅ¿equence; For in our caÅ¿e, there is no reÅ¿traint at all, but it is rather a paÅ¿Å¿age for money. If there be juÅ¿t oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion of a reÅ¿traint, the law giveth the King power to reÅ¿traine; but when Merchants may without hurt of the State, have paÅ¿Å¿age, as in our caÅ¿e, to enforce them to pay for that paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age, is in my opinion, as unlawfull as to enforce any man whatÅ¿oever, to pay for doing that which he may lawfully doe; Merchants have (as I may Å¿o Å¿ay) as good inheritance in their trade, as any man in his lands, and when it may Å¿tand with the good of the Å¿tate, that they may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:157030:71"/> paÅ¿Å¿e, they ought to paÅ¿Å¿e as freely without charge impoÅ¿ed on them, as any man ought to hold his inheritance, or any Artificer, or other TradeÅ¿man ought to exerciÅ¿e their lawfull trades, and means of living, free from burdens to be laid on by the Kings abÅ¿olute power; if all others Å¿hould be free, and onely Merchants, (who adventure their perÅ¿ons and eÅ¿tates in Å¿o many dangers, to bring us from farre places, Å¿uch things, as without which we cannot Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t, and to returne us profit for our Å¿uperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) Å¿hould be Å¿ubject to involuntarie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, their eÅ¿tate were of all other mens moÅ¿t unhappy and Å¿laviÅ¿h, which of all other trades, is indeed the nobleÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t worthy to be cheriÅ¿hed.</p>
            <p>And here by the way I note, that in all other Nations of the world, where the Merchant is Å¿ubject to impoÅ¿itions at the Kings pleaÅ¿ure, the Landlord, the Farmer, the Artificer, the very Plowman, and all others are in like Å¿ort Å¿ubject to Taxes and burdens, when the King pleaÅ¿eth, The Merchant is not the man alone that is Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Taxes, and all other men free: if in the frame of our Common wealth, it were thought fit to free all other Trades and ProfeÅ¿Å¿ions from taxes, much more ought it to be thought reaÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that our Merchants Å¿hould be free, and by all means poÅ¿Å¿ible, incouraged in their Trade: For our caÅ¿e is not, as it is with other nations of the Continent; we are IÅ¿landers, and divided
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:157030:72"/> by the Sea, from all the world, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect, have Å¿uch uÅ¿e of Merchants, as we cannot live without them; if therefore any Å¿hould be free amongÅ¿t us, it Å¿hould be the Merchant, and not the quite contrary, onely the Merchant charged, and all others free: <hi>Plato</hi> in his 8. book <hi>de Rep.</hi> is of opinion, that the Merchant for his incouragement to trade, Å¿hould be free from all CuÅ¿tome whatÅ¿oever, we Å¿eek only to be free of involuntary impoÅ¿itions. But to return to the Argument of reÅ¿traint, from whence I am a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle digreÅ¿Å¿ed; if it be a good Argument, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the King may reÅ¿traine in <hi>Toto,</hi> he may reÅ¿train in <hi>Tanto;</hi> It will not be denied unto me (for it followeth neceÅ¿Å¿arily) that in caÅ¿es where he cannot reÅ¿traine in <hi>Toto,</hi> he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traine in <hi>Tanto:</hi> But there is no man that will Å¿ay that he may reÅ¿traine the entrance and paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age of all Merchants, to and from all the parts of the world whatÅ¿oever, without any limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, but the reÅ¿traint to endure for ever, and for all kinds of Merchandizes whatÅ¿oever, of moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary and common uÅ¿e, to be brought into, or carried out of the Realme; There is no man I Å¿uppoÅ¿e will Å¿ay, That the Law hath given the King power to make Å¿o un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaÅ¿onable a reÅ¿traint as this; for it were to give him a power to deÅ¿troy merchandize, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently, to ruine the Common wealth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide, it were againÅ¿t the law of nations, and of reaÅ¿on it Å¿elf; It cannot be imagined, that any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:157030:72"/> wiÅ¿e law in the world Å¿hould allow it. But if our ImpoÅ¿itions (as it is Å¿aid) doe implie a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traint, and that a reÅ¿traint be always the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of all ImpoÅ¿itions, Then Å¿uch an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable reÅ¿traint, as I have Å¿poken of, muÅ¿t needs be preÅ¿uppoÅ¿ed to have been the ground or fore-runner of our preÅ¿ent impoÅ¿ition, For in our impoÅ¿itions, are not all the merchandizes of neceÅ¿Å¿ary and common uÅ¿e charged? Are not all the Merchants Denizens and Strangers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting from any part, or exporting to any part of the world, Å¿ubject to the charge? is there any limitation of time, but to endure for ever? if I Å¿ay Å¿uch a reÅ¿traint had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, which I Å¿uppoÅ¿e no man will denie, then whatÅ¿oever implieth Å¿uch a ReÅ¿traint (which our impoÅ¿itions doe) is likewiÅ¿e unlawfull; But the ill conÅ¿equence of this their argument drawne from the Kings power of reÅ¿traint, will beÅ¿t appeare by comparing it to other caÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>I little doubt but the King upon Å¿ome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, may lawfully reÅ¿traine the paÅ¿Å¿age of all men through the gates of <hi>London;</hi> as for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, when the Citie Å¿hall be beÅ¿ieged, or in the time of an extreme plague; Nay is it not by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie derived onely from him, that the gates are Å¿hut every night? Doth it follow therefore, that becauÅ¿e he may doe it upon Å¿ome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaÅ¿ion, or at Å¿ome time that he may Å¿hut up the paÅ¿Å¿age for ever? or that preÅ¿uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:157030:73"/> Å¿uch a reÅ¿traint by his abÅ¿olute power, he may lay an impoÅ¿ition upon every burthen of any thing brought in, or carried out, as the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and many other States in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> doe, or upon every man by the Poll, that Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e through the gates?</p>
            <p>You Å¿ee the weakneÅ¿Å¿e and danger of the conÅ¿equence of this Argument, and how it tends to juÅ¿tifie ImpoÅ¿itions within the land. And Å¿o I leave it, and proceed to the next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Ports and Haven Townes of England, are (Å¿ay they) the Kings,<note place="margin">The third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the Ports are the Kings, and that he may open them, and Å¿hut them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth, anÅ¿wered.</note> and in regard thereof, he may open and Å¿hut them upon what conditions he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth;</hi> I anÅ¿were,</p>
            <p>I. That the PoÅ¿ition, that all the Ports are the Kings, is not generally true; For Subjects may alÅ¿o be owners of Ports, as may appeare by the Patent Roll of 3. <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>M.</hi> 1. Parl. where you Å¿hall finde, that King <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. granted to the <hi>Lords of Port Townes,</hi> the forfeitures granted to him by Parliament, for not duly paying the new CuÅ¿tome of the demy-Marke within every Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Port, of theirs, where the Merchandizes Å¿hould happen to be imported or exported. But admitting the truth of the poÅ¿ition, yet is the conÅ¿equence as weake and dangerous, as of any of the reÅ¿t of their arguments; For are not all the gates of Cities and Townes, and all the Streets and Highwayes in England the Kings, and as much Å¿ubject to be open or Å¿hut at his pleaÅ¿ure, as the Ports are? Nay, whenÅ¿oever

Nay the gates of the Kings owne houÅ¿e (for the purpoÅ¿e, his Pallace of <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi>) are his in a farre neerer degree then any of theÅ¿e, may he therefore by his Proclamation impoÅ¿e upon every man that Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e in or out at <hi>WeÅ¿tmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter</hi> Hall doore a Å¿umme of money? DoubtleÅ¿Å¿e he may not; becauÅ¿e the King is a perÅ¿on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and his Subjects ought to have acceÅ¿Å¿e to him, as to the fountaine of JuÅ¿tice, and to the Courts of JuÅ¿tice, Å¿itting by his authoritie; I make little doubt, but his MajeÅ¿tie may upon juÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion, cauÅ¿e any of theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages to be Å¿hut, as he may alÅ¿o the paÅ¿Å¿age at the Havens; But when the PaÅ¿Å¿age may without danger to the State, be open, and that the Subjects may paÅ¿Å¿e, his MajeÅ¿tie may not then exact money for their paÅ¿Å¿age; For the law hath given the King power over theÅ¿e things, for the good of the Common-wealth, and not thereby to charge and burden the Subject; If the King may not exact money for paÅ¿Å¿age in and out of his Court gates, becauÅ¿e of the publikeneÅ¿Å¿e of his PerÅ¿on; Nor for paÅ¿Å¿age through the gates
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:157030:74"/> of Cities, much leÅ¿Å¿e may he for paÅ¿Å¿age out at the Ports, which are the great gates of the Kingdom, and which the Å¿ubject ought as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy, as the ayre or the water.</p>
            <p>Another of their arguments is this,<note place="margin">The fourth argument that the King is bound at his owne charge, to protect Merchants, &amp; therefore it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary it Å¿hould be in his power to lay moderate ImpoÅ¿itions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes for raiÅ¿ing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to defray his charge; AnÅ¿wered.</note> 
               <hi>The king is bound to protect Merchants from Å¿poile by the enemie, he ought to fortifie the Havens, that their Å¿hips may there abide in Å¿afety; he ought, if occaÅ¿ion be, to Å¿end AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors to forrein Princes, to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate for them,</hi> and many the like charges is the King by the Law to undergoe for the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Merchants. It is reaÅ¿on therefore that his expence be defraied out of the profit made by Merchants, and conÅ¿equently, that he may impoÅ¿e upon Merchandize a moderate charge, thereby to repay himÅ¿elf.</p>
            <p>The conÅ¿equence of this Argument is thus farre true, The law expects that the King Å¿hould protect Merchants, therefore it alloweth him out of Merchandize a revenue for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his charge, which is the old CuÅ¿tome due (as at firÅ¿t I Å¿aid) by the Common law, But it is no good conÅ¿equence,<note place="margin">The Fifth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that all forraine Princes have power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, and if our King had not the like, it might be very inconvenient to this State. AnÅ¿wered.</note> that therefore he may take what he liÅ¿t, no more then he may at his pleaÅ¿ure increaÅ¿e that old revenue, which the law giveth him for protecting of Subjects in their Å¿uits, or for protecting Wards, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Another Argument of theirs is this, <hi>All other Princes of the world may impoÅ¿e upon merchandize at their pleaÅ¿ure, and Å¿o may make our Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes leÅ¿Å¿e vendible with them, by laying an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:157030:74"/> upon them, to be paid by us, when they are brought into their Territories, whereby their owne Commodities of the Å¿ame nature, may be Å¿old more to the gaine of their Merchants, and our Merchant impoveriÅ¿hed, or driven from his Trade; They may alÅ¿o lay ImpoÅ¿itions upon our Merchants, fetching Commodities from thence, and leave their owne Merchants free from any ImpoÅ¿ition in the Å¿ame caÅ¿e, by which their merchants Å¿hall reape all the profit by that commoditie, in affording it better cheape to us here, then we can fetch it, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our merchants Å¿hall be undone,</hi> Many the like caÅ¿es have been put to prove, That if the King of England may not impoÅ¿e, as other Princes may, they Å¿hall be able at their pleaÅ¿ure to deÅ¿troy our trading; This I conceive was the Å¿ame as now it is, during all that time from <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. till Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and doubtleÅ¿Å¿e it could not but Å¿ometimes (during that long Å¿pace) Å¿o fall out, that forreine Princes did put their power in practiÅ¿e to our prejudice, and yet we heare not of any ImpoÅ¿ition laid by any of our Kings, by their abÅ¿olute power, which may give any man aÅ¿Å¿urance, that they tooke Å¿ome other courÅ¿e to meet with the inconvenience, and in deed, the meanes are divers, which theÅ¿e our Kings uÅ¿ed to prevent it.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t they were carefull in all their Leagues and Treaties with forrain Princes, Å¿pecially to provide for it, as may appeare by the Records of the ancient Leagues: Neither is there any
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:157030:75"/> League of late time, that hath not had an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle for proviÅ¿ion in this point; which Leagues for the moÅ¿t part, are upon oath on both parts. And yet for further Å¿ecuritie, our Kings have always had AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors reÅ¿ident in the Courts of Å¿uch forrain Princes, to put them in minde of their Leagues, if upon any occaÅ¿ion our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have in that caÅ¿e happened to be never Å¿o little wronged by them, &amp; if upon complaint of the AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador, our merchants have not found redreÅ¿Å¿e, our Kings have held the League as broken, and denounced Warre, or Å¿eiÅ¿ed all the goods of the Å¿ame Princes Subjects within England; and I dare Å¿ay there have been more warres undertaken by our Princes, againÅ¿t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain nations, onely for this cauÅ¿e, then for any one other cauÅ¿e whatÅ¿oever.</p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, our Kings have in this caÅ¿e Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made uÅ¿e of that their Prerogative of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traint, either by prohibiting our Merchants from carrying our Commodities into thoÅ¿e parts, where they are charged with ImpoÅ¿itions, that Å¿o by the want of our Commodities, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Princes might be enforced to abate their ImpoÅ¿itions laid upon them, or by reÅ¿training the Merchants of forrain Princes to import or export commodities from hence; By which meanes forraine Princes have been compelled to deale favourably with our Merchants for the good of their owne Subjects; All theÅ¿e are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ordinary means to prevent or redreÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:157030:75"/> the inconvenience which may grow by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions of other Princes: If all theÅ¿e ordinary means Å¿hould happen to faile, which can hardly Å¿o fall out, and that the laying of ImpoÅ¿itions be indeed the only means that is left to redreÅ¿Å¿e the inconvenience, why Å¿hould not that be done by Act of Parliament as well in theÅ¿e times, as it was in 7.<hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. to take downe the ImpoÅ¿ition of Foure Ducates upon a But of MalmÅ¿ey, impoÅ¿ed by the Venetians, And as it was done by Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> the 19. yeere of her Reigne, to prevent the laying of ImpoÅ¿itions by forraine Princes upon <hi>Salt-fiÅ¿h,</hi> as may appeare by the printed Statutes of 19. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10. But as I have Å¿aid, the providence of the Prince, and ordinary power of reÅ¿traint may very well meet with the inconvenience.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e are the chiefe reaÅ¿ons made in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of impoÅ¿itions, the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of them, and their dangerous conÅ¿equence, you cannot but perceive; For by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿ons, Taxes within the Land, may be as well proved to be lawfull. On the contrary part, you have heard the reaÅ¿ons againÅ¿t impoÅ¿itions fortified by many Records and Statutes in the point; So as I conclude, that <hi>ImpoÅ¿itions,</hi> neither in the time of warre, or other the greateÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿itie or occaÅ¿ion that may be (much leÅ¿Å¿e in the time of peace) neither upon forraine, nor inland Commodities of whatÅ¿oever nature, be they never Å¿o Å¿uperfluous or unneceÅ¿Å¿ary, neither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:157030:76"/> Merchants, Strangers nor Denizens, may be laid by the Kings abÅ¿olute power, without aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent of Parliament, be it for never Å¿o Å¿hort a time, much leÅ¿Å¿e to endure for ever, as ours. Though this be now my opinion, yet am not I Å¿o obÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate therein, but if yet I heare better reaÅ¿on, I will once againe change my minde; in the meane while, you Å¿ee I had reaÅ¿on to alter my firÅ¿t: opinion, as being grounded upon very weak ReaÅ¿ons, as now they appeare unto me. And Å¿o I Å¿uppoÅ¿e they doe alÅ¿o unto you.</p>
